10,507,48,FALSCH,"Thanks for the feedback! I have noticed that I don't binge as much either and I think that's because I'm genuinely happier. I think I tend to binge when I'm stressed or feeling particularly down and I haven't had those feelings very much lately so that helped! Although exams are coming up and I know I'm going to be very stressed out so that will be tough. But I like the grounding techniques and the counting ones a lot so I'll be sure to use them during exam week and hopefully they'll help! The thing about pasta and meat is that I don't consider them forbidden, I love both of those things a lot. Chicken and steak and probably my favorite things to eat! But those are the two types of food that give me the most anxiety when eating and fear of immediate weight gain after eating them, which makes it difficult for me to enjoy them when I do eat them. Honestly I can't remember when that started but for as long as I can remember I've always ordered vegetarian things or not eaten the meat in certain things and I have no idea why! So I guess it just stuck and when I started to get paranoid about my body I guess I figured that if I started eating it now it would make me gain weight. But it helps when I remind myself that I actually do love meat and pasta and they are both okay to eat especially since I don't that often.

19,555,68,FALSCH,"The only problem with my grocery shop choice is that I can seem to make myself eat the carrots and salad. In regards to inncidents that can ""snap"" me out of binging, I have no idea. I know lots of people try/say to go workout when you want to eat, but that doesn't work for me. Or they say to do some sort of activity that distracts you. However, it is very difficult for me to find things to distract me from wanting to eat. Binging to me is literally an adiction, where it's always in the back of my mind at night, no matter what I do, whether its reading, watching tv, homework, cleaning, writing, etc. The plate inncident was different because it was something that had to be cleaned up NOW because otherwise it would harm people living in my apartment, and I was really worried if whether or not I got rid of all the pieces on the floor. Additionally, this week, I made a mini goal to concentrate on eatting better, and didn't excersize. I didn't count calories as much and ate better foods for me and limited my portions and tried not to binge. I binged only three days. The first was because I couldn't sleep due to social anxiety, the second was because my friend took me out to a mexican restaurant and I was starving and I couldn't say no to the chips, and the thrid was becaue I attended an awful work party.

I've identified that ""open kitchen"" situations are much more difficult for me than the dining halls, so that's why I binge more at home than at school.

I never even write them down as avoiding food because they hardly tempt me at this point. Despite my lack of a plan I have incorporated one into my diet and have made improvements regarding my attitude about it: earlier this week, I had a bout of what Vaden believed to be viral gastroenteritis, which is sort of a 24-hour stomach bug that goes away on its own. So I had nausea/vomiting/diarrhea for a day (I know, it was horrible, and I was also on my period at the same time haha) but then to recover they suggest very bland foods so I ate both a donut and mashed potatoes the next day, which was quite unusual and sort of liberating. Then today my roommate asked me if I wanted her to save me a bagel and I said yes, AND I had lemon poppyseed bread at breakfast. I vaguely wonder if I will gain weight if I continue to eat bread, but it's not like I have my ideal body without eating bread for years, so.",06:09.8,0,0,0,mixed,0,Intervention process,Stress/stressors,Symptoms,,,,

I'm a bit uncomfortable talking over the phone. How about I explain why I'm interested in Lantern and my goals from using it?
In the past year, both my father and brother have been diagnosed with either diabetes or borderline diabetes. I also know my grandfathers on both sides of my family had diabetes. It?s only a matter of time before I get it. And right now, I eat way too much sugar.
I also emotionally eat by binging. When I?m stressed or sad, I eat to get the dopamine to feel better. I?ve done this for probably six years now, but it?s gotten much worse due to various factors such as loss of a social circle and pressure to find a job after I graduate. 
When I entered college I weighed 145 pounds. Now I weigh 160. I?ve gone through bursts to try to loose the weight, but I always end up gaining it back. 
Essentially, I?d like to develop better eating habits so that I

2. Prevent disease
3. Loose just a bit to feel more confident in my body.

My binging seems to not have quite a controls over me at the moment and I am trying to keep positive towards my goals. After talking to you Thursday I believe my activity for that day had to do with binging and it was very insightful. One of the activities involved trying to stick to a certain plan. Some of the plans were drinking more water, thinking before you ate, sticking to a grocery list, and more. I decided to pick the grocery list one because I think if I plan out what I am going to eat it will help me not go overboard and it also will help me with my meal tracker.

I made kind of a realization today. I binged and wasn't too upset with myself but I know I will be if it turns into a cycle which it usually does but I knew before it happened that it was going to and I actively chose to let it happen when I knew I had the power to stop it. I view being able to binge as having time to relax. I am able to stop myself from binging by thinking about the aftermath and if I have something important that evening or the following morning I am usually able to prevent it from happening because I know that I will be uncomfortable and upset during whatever I have scheduled. I have been insanely stressed with school, tests, my job, and my two internships that I feel like I have had no down time in the last few weeks and I don't see any down time in my immediate future so today in my 4 hours of freedom before my study group met I let myself binge because I intertwine binging on food with relaxing. I was then so unbelievably full and uncomfortable during studying. I often am able to curb the binges by thinking of how it will affect an event in my future but I still associate binging with relaxing and I need to work on breaking that association.

I have no idea b/c you're a very sporadic communicator
The on and off communication is kind of driving me crazy, and I don't even want to be friends w/ someone who can't complete a conversation, and gets distracted and then responds 24 hours later. 
If you don't want to talk me to again (ie you decided there's some reason you don't like me), just say so, instead of just randomly ignoring me.
If you do like me (ie you think I'm special), can we talk briefly about how we can communicate in a way that works for both of us? 
I know you had a rough week, so I don't mean to give you a hard time, but there are basic expectations re: communication that are common courtesy. 
I think you're special and there's a bunch of things I want to do with you! And if you have issues w/ me not knowing what I want, exclusivity, or this just being a rebound, could we talk about it? Sort of ironic b/c I've stopped seeing a bunch of people I was seeing so that I could spend more time w/ you, and now you're totally MIA. 
I want to make plans w/ you and when you totally ignore my request to make plans, it's very difficult for the rest of my schedule, and it makes me feel really unloved. I am one of those people who is used to constant affection, but that's what happens in most mature relationships. 
If you wake up at an odd hour again, feel free to call me at any hour - I'll probably be up! I don't like to leave things hanging and would really love to come to a resolution on this one way or another.

So I guess I clung to the thought that I really didn't need lunch and that would cause me to lose weight. I don't really know if that worked or whatever but I've stuck to that for a while and it's a hard habit to shake. I've been trying though but I think it might take some time before it really gets better. My body image is really affected by comparing myself to others and how I used to look my senior year of highschool. I have noticed that I'm not scanning my old Facebook photos as much anymore which is really nice. However I live with 8 girls and everyone is very obsessed with looks and the gym and things like that. Two girls in particular are especially skinny and really pretty and people really like them and it's hard not to compare myself to them.

245,532,51,FALSCH,"Hello Caroline, Running is my primary form of exercise. I run anywhere from as 25-70 miles per week, and have done so for the past couple years. Running serves as a way to wipe the slate clean so to speak, to burn calories, to be outdoors, to de-stress, to be away from people, to do something physical, to challenge myself not just mentally, etc.. Running serves many purposes for me. I also bike aggressively, use the elliptical machine, row, and do some weight lifting, pull-ups, push-ups, etc. Cardio is definitely my primary form of exercise thought. I experience intense anxiety and irritation when I do not get cardio in even when I plan to take a day off. I have difficulty transitioning after eating to whatever I'm doing next and dealing with intrusive thoughts about food. I often times find myself thinking about food either in the back of my mind or in the front of my mind for much of the day. I also have difficulty distracting myself and re-focusing on something else when caught in these patterned thoughts. I am working on disciplining my mind and learning how to make my behaviors more intentional. I notice that when I feel that my eating is out of control, my irritation and anxiety become even more potent.

255,689,55,FALSCH,"Hi, thanks for the feedback! For restricting, I had overeaten the day before and wasn't feeling particularly hungry (in addition I woke up really late, around lunchtime, since it was a Saturday). In terms of a victory, I think due to stress/lack of a regular sleeping schedule/a changing (slowing?) metabolism throughout college, I ended up gaining a fair amount of weight. The fact that I can tell that the weight is fat rather than muscle or something height-related makes me want to lose weight to get back to where I was freshman year. However, I think that I've established a guilty relationship with food because anytime I end up losing a few pounds some situation results in my binge eating again. I think I have really bipolar, extreme habits---i.e. I'll be extremely healthy and exercise for a few weeks, then there will a period where I overeat (i.e. eating when I'm not hungry) and don't exercise.

5- Moved from MA to DC in the beginning of August
6-Homeless between August and November (stayed with a friend). Had few consultancies to support myself but the experience was stressful.
7- Found a part time job in November
8- Starting to feel a bit settled now, moved to my own place.
9- Now realize that job is stressful and that I need to work hard to figure my boss out, which is stressing me out and affecting my eating habit.
10- I have an annoying landlord.

Points 1-8 affected my routine, my food intake, and surely my excerisze. 

Sleep was very poor throughout. 

Alchohol intake is increasing a lot (maybe a glass every other day or so) This is a lot for me as it is starting to get habitual.

I'm still trying to figure the site out, it's kind of confusing but I'm sure it's just because everything is new. I would add my picture if I could figure out how. 

Anyway...I decided to give this a try because I'm feeling overwhelmed and it's bringing me down. I've been working with a psychologist for a year now (my first attempt at therapy). I see her once a week and I don't contact her outside of session. I see a psychiatrist too. I started taking zoloft in January. I'm currently at 200mg.

I live with OCD (it sucks, it really does). I guess I've had it since childhood. I've been going to therapy and taking medication for that and PTSD and whatever else is in my file. I'm feeling stuck. I was doing good for a while but now I'm doing all these new things and it's freaking me out.

I'm trying this for added support, to help myself. I feel like I'm failing. Like I can't fix myself no matter how hard I try. 

This is long, sorry. I'm not sure if you even wanted to know any of this..ugh! This is kind of weird for me. 

PS
I don't think my psychologist is doing CBT with me. It's more just talking about my week, feelings, social stuff (because I'm not good at being social) and family relationships.",51:38.4,0,0,0,negative,1,Symptoms,Intervention process,intervention process,relationship with the coach,,,

613,921,68,FALSCH,"Hi Anna! 
I was able to try the mirror-mirror exercise. It was difficult to keep all the thoughts positive, so I started to do it systematically. I gave each body part (or as many as I could think of) a compliment and I worked my way up. Some things were challenging, and I couldn't always come up with unique compliments, and there were a couple parts that I just couldn't. (I'm working on compliments for those.) But that felt good! I tried it again last night when I was laying in bed?kind of a conversation with my body. 
As for the conversations I've been having with people, it's nice to be able to air those feelings so openly. We tell each other when we're having bad days and when we're having good ones. I think it's nice to have people to go to about these feelings. But it was also nice to be around people who were trying so hard to be positive about their bodies. It seems like so many people have such negative things to say about their bodies. And the media doesn't help! I'm so sick of seeing weight loss help every time I open Pinterest. Anyway, I feel like being around that positivity will help me to be positive more consistently. 
As I'm finishing up the unit about body image, the program asked me to let you know what I'll continue. I really like the body check-ins. I think I'll keep doing those, either online or in my head throughout the day. Thanks for everything!

,,,,"that's very true. i have to learn to be more compassionate towards myself. i sometimes wonder what it'd be like though if i didn't have expectations for myself? i wonder if it's a fear that if i liberated myself that i would lose myself (ie stop caring, gain lots of weight, etc etc)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"oh wait i wrote this for the automatic thought... not sure if it went thru: ""i automatically thought that because of this one action, that i will never reconnect with my body and truly listen to myself. however i need to be patient with myself and see that this is all a process. what am i learning from this one situation? mindfulness is really hard to get to!!!

well i was watching tv, and since im' really used to eating while watching -- i wanted to chew. and that's normal. that's final. i just need to recognize that. im not weak for eating that extra bar despite being relaly full. it's because it's what you're used to whenever you do that specific activity. maybe next time, just eat the orange and not the bar. maybe eat a little less at your new meal so that you can enjoy it.

,,,,"Hi Sarah,
I read through your feedback a few times. I don't think I'm in CBT therapy with my face-to-face therapist. All of this stuff I am reading and learning is new to me. 
I did notice the last technique I tried really made my anxiety spike. It was hard. I have a hard time rationalizing sometimes. I didn't like that that technique at all. I'll still practice with it but it's so uncomfortable. 
I think I need to start over with the program and redo the steps. I feel like I'm not doing this right. I don't know.
I did go to the interview today. It was hard. Sometimes I get to this spot where it's ""do or die"" in my head. I turn everything off get through what I have to get through and then when it's all over, I panic. 
I got the job. It's a part time position at a deli type place. I decided to get a job because my husband wants me to. I walked out of that interview and froze. I'm really scared to do this. And in a restaurant of all places. I don't know how I'm going to manage. I don't know if I'm ready.
I'm trying to stay positive about it. My husband works from home and my mom is home all day to. It's very stressful for me sometimes so maybe being out of the house more will be okay. I don't know. I want to back out.
I'm so confused. 
Maybe I need to sleep and see how I feel tomorrow. 
I do find your feedback helpful. I save the e-mails so I can go back and re read them. 
Goodnight,
Anne",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I have been thinking about telling her what I'm doing here...because it is freaking me out :) I really wish there was a way for me to access previous worksheets I've done so I can print them out and take them with me. Once I submit my writing, It's gone...I have no way to review and see progress (not sure if I am explaining right). I have a long history with..well bad stuff. I struggle a lot with anxieties. I've been in face to face therapy for a year. I am trying (again) to have a life outside of my home. So my plan is to use this program between sessions with Betty. A kind of added support to keep me from giving up and quitting everything. I didn't realize the amount of 'work' CBT style is. It's going to take some getting use to. I'm still trying to figure out how to not overwhelm myself. I think maybe I am moving to quickly through the program. I want to go back and try some of the earlier stuff again. okay, I'll leave it that for now. I have my apt. with Betty on Thursdays. I'm going to start a list of things to talk about lol.

Then all sorts of things start bothering me and I spiral. Working on breathing did help. I still catch myself holding my breath though. And sometimes I'm not able to take a deep breath in. It feels like I'm suffocating when I know I'm not. All in all I did okay.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,I quit my job tonight. I can't handle it right now. Not a good day for me. It's late and I'm on my way to bed. I'm going to rest tomorrow and come back to this on Monday. Thanks for your last note. It helps me to know that there are some positives.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Well the whole job thing lasted two weeks. I have mixed feelings over it. The positives I was thing about didn't have to do with the job. More that I am able to do something for an extended period of time away from my home.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes, I agree with you. I've been having trouble with OCD thoughts lately and can't seem to snap out of it or let them go easily. Between that and sleeping, I haven't had much energy for anything else. I'm worried to track those thoughts because they bug me so much. I feel like a bad person who thinks horrible things. I'm worried for what will happen if I write them down. I think that's what's holding me up right now with the program.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I haven't brought it up. We have been talking a lot about working and my relationships. I want to. I get so wrapped up in what we are talking about that it has taken a back seat and I forget to tell her. 

I'm doing okay today. I feel more relaxed at home (when I'm alone). 

I'm trying to get back into working with the program a little everyday. I've been so stressed out. I feel like I can't take time for myself or people will get mad. I know this sounds off but I really deal this way. 

Okay I need to work on cleaning :) talk soon.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Ohh I did read what you said about OCD thoughts. I've been able to do what your talking about with some things. It's hard when I'm already down the road of freaking out. It's hard to explain but sometimes (like when I'm afraid someone is going to get hurt) it's real in the moment. I don't realize that it was silly until it's all over. Does that make sense? 

I can do what your saying sometimes though. It's a lot of work ?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Rough night for me. I'm alive though so I think I'm good. I think I did better with today's session. I'm feeling better anyway. I have to find a better way to know I took my medication. It's really bugging me lately.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi, I can do Thursday morning any time between 8 and 9:15 pst. I forget, do you call me? Or do I call you? Okay let me know where in that time frame works best for you. Thanks!! Oh and I had a pretty good low anxiety day! I got hung up once but not too bad.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes 8am is fine. Is there an additional fee for the phone call? I don't think we talked about that. - the anxiety has mostly gone down because I'm at home more. I feel better at home. The family dynamic gets to me but not as much as having a social life, volunteering, working...etc. I do miss volunteering, I want to get back into it. The people..and dealing with the dynamic there is too stressful.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi, I've been at the hospital all night with my daughter. She is going to be okay. We're still here. I just want to check in and let you know I'll probably be sleeping all day. I'm exhausted and still trying to get over my own cold. Talk soon! Sorry- it's been one thing after another this past week.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Sarah, sorry I haven't been keeping up as much as I would like. Everyone is taking turns being sick at my house. I'm trying to keep up there too. I'm having trouble making this a priority. Even though I really want to. I can't seem to find time to make myself do it. I'm tired and need to get some sleep right now but I'm going to make a better effort. I feel bad.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hmm..maybe I could use some suggestions on how to be more consistent with the program. I think too, it makes me uncomfortable at times and I don't like feeling uncomfortable :) In other words, I see my own pattern of avoiding the issues I have. Pretending there not there so I don't have to actually do anything about it. Sounds silly I know but sometimes I don't even realize I'm doing that. I did today because I went to do the session and then shut the program down because ""it was too hard"" Yeah... not cool at all. My husband calls me the avoidance queen. I just tell myself I'm being lazy. I don't know. I need to figure something out though, I can't keep living like this.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes, I like your idea. It sounds a little overwhelming..I don't know where to start. Do you want me to work on making a program anxiety list and post it here? Is procrastination a part of anxiety? I'm just wondering because I have a huge problem with that. I'm being serious. It holds me back a lot. I think that's what's happening with this program too. I keep putting it off. Right now I can't continue because the exposure learning session is too hard. I log in, remember that is where I left off, and then I log out and tell myself I'll do it later. I feel bad for it, I don't want to waste your time because I'm not trying hard enough. So there is a lot of guilt there for me too. Which makes me want to quit and tell myself I failed. I want to start over from the beginning so bad and try again. Do it right. Ugh! I'm sorry. I'm trying to share what's going through my head but I don't want to be annoying. Talking to Betty (my therapist) about using this program is at the very top of my anxiety list..like a 17.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Sarah, I will work on my list today and post it tonight. The ""starting over"" bit is a huge obstacle for me. It affects most everything I do. It's one of the main reasons I give up and quit. Okay so I'll make time to sit and work on my list today and we can go from there. Thanks! I'm starting to feel less overwhelmed.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Messaging with Sarah ? 2 higher if I feel like I?m not doing a good job or keeping up
Daily check in?s ? 0-5 depending on my day
Reading the sessions - 4 sometimes higher like the exposure learning. I think I quit at that one
Relaxation techniques ? 0-2 I have trouble relaxing. Getting my body to muscles to relax
Tools ? 3-7 depending on my day or the issue. Sometimes it?s even higher like the cue tracking and the reframing tool.
Talking to Betty about the program ? 10 I?m afraid of her reaction. I don?t want her to be upset with me.
I hope I did this right. I don't think I left anything out.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I'm working with the breathing exercise. The counting breaths one. I practice when I'm out of the house too. It helps. Just focusing on the one exercise helps too. I don't feel so overwhelmed.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hello! Things are going pretty well. My efforts to really avoid trigger foods have overall been going really well. School ends mid-June for me, so I have a little more than a month left. Going into the more stressful parts of the quarter, I want to continue focusing on avoiding triggers and doing things that help me clear my mind, like exercising and taking walks.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"1:30 PST on Wednesday works great for me. Yes, I think the program is definitely helpful so far. It's really good to have some structure around eating and body image because I was having trouble with that at college.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes, I'm looking forward to tomorrow as well! My day has been good but pretty busy.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks for checking in! When I feel out of control when I'm eating, it's usually either when I feel rushed or stressed, or when I take a reasonable amount the first time I go through the dining hall and then go back for seconds, which tend to be less healthy. I don't have access to a working scale that I know of, although there may be one at the gym, so I'm not sure how the weekly weighing activity will work.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"That's a really good idea. I did better at choosing what I was hungry for and not more at lunch today, but I will try that approach for dinner.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Oh no I didn't!! I did yesterday's session on my phone instead of on the computer, so the number scale must have recorded it wrong. No, I did not vomit or use diet pills/laxatives. Sorry for the miscommunication!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I tried it a little more today when I was snacking between meals. I was aware of how much I was eating. I'm also getting a little more aware of how much food I serve myself in relation to how hungry I am and realizing that my plate doesn't need to be full in order for me to be full, if that makes sense.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I want to work on taking deep breaths more instinctively when I start to feel off-centered. I want to try to catch myself before I get too wrapped up in my concerns and take a moment to recollect myself.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"The forbidden foods activity is interesting, but I don't know if it's going to be the most useful for me because I generally have trouble avoiding my ""forbidden"" or guilt-inducing foods rather than strictly avoiding them. Do you have any suggestions on how to make this activity useful for me?",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I can see the longer message in the notification email I got, but I can't figure out how to see it on the lantern website. After tracking for three weeks, I've been noticing that I generally stop and think about how my actions would reflect in my day's tracking before getting more food. Yes, this coming week will be pretty busy and I won't always be in a place where I can choose what to eat, so I think it would be really helpful to plan my meals. Halloween and being out with friends in particular could be a challenge. I think what has been useful in terms of not binging is that even if I eat more than I would like to, I feel aware and in control of that. I still want to change that crucial decision-making time, but I think I've felt more responsible for any overeating that has happened. I suppose that is improvement, but there's still some work to be done. I think my body image is largely affected by comparing myself to others (not the best thing, I'm aware) and how clothing fits me versus how it used to, or at least how I remember it fitting. Some mirrors and seeing myself from particular angles seem to be triggers for body image thoughts. Yes, I think it might be helpful to use the body image tracking tool to help myself not get bogged down in my thoughts. I've stopped and breathed once or twice, which was helpful, but there were other instances where I think it would have been helpful for me to have done that where I didn't.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks for your thoughts on the activities. I've been really busy, but I'm going to get back on track of doing the activities daily.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"And yes, the problem that I have is not eating my ""forbidden"" foods too frequently and then feeling guilty afterwards.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,I think I'm progressing well. Yesterday went really well. I felt very in control of what I was eating and aware of when and how much I was hungry.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,My favorite part has probably been the daily aspect of it and how it reminds me to not get upset about my eating but figure out how to improve my habits. It really helps to have something to do every day and have you to make me feel obligated to continue and help myself.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm home for thanksgiving, so I'm going to do my best to be more on top of the program. So far I've been really good at being in tune with how hungry I am and being conscious of the kind of food I'm eating. I will make a plan for thanksgiving day soon.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm using my phone again, so in case the sliding scale for how many meals/bingeing times/compensatory times is off, I had three meals, didn't binge, and didn't do compensatory behaviors.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also, I think I started one day's program a couple days ago and didn't finish it until today. Whoops.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hope your thanksgiving was good as well! I'm on my phone again, no bingeing, no compensatory behaviors.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"That sounds like a good idea. I think I would like to become more comfortable with feeling my emotions fully, since this section is focused on emotions and the holiday season can be an emotional time.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"In reply to your longer feedback: Yes, I have reminded myself of why I'm doing what I'm doing when making decisions about what I'm eating. I think the decrease in bingeing was in part due to being at home and not being as stressed, but I also made a point of really focusing on experiencing my food and eating slowly, which I think will carry over now that I'm back at school. I'm also making sugary foods and empty carbs (white or processed grains) something special that I avoid on most days. I think that is helping because if I start eating those foods, it often becomes hard to stop. In other words, I think those are my trigger foods, and by avoiding them I'm preventing bingeing. I think what might help me further would be to work towards being more comfortable with not feeling obligated to eat a large meal at each mealtime if I'm not hungry. In other words, just because it's 6 pm doesn't mean I need to eat a full meal if I'm not particularly hungry. Checking in with my emotions was good. I did a fair amount of mindfulness practice the summer before last and the beginning of last school year, and it felt really nice to get back to that. Also, it was liberating to have the motivation to feel my emotions when I went home because I realized that I had missed my family, even though I hadn't been aware of it. I think I usually try to avoid being stressed or sad because they're not fun emotions. Identifying emotions will be good for me personally because there's some pressure at my school to always say that I'm doing well, even if things are going great. Also, with the stress of finals and the holidays, it will be good to be able to work through my emotions instead of bottling them up to deal with later. The pink elephant exercise was a good visual aid in understanding how emotion avoidance works. I think I tend to push away my emotions and only think logically if I'm busy or just don't want to evaluate them and think about what they're being caused by. I generally save them until I can talk to my mom or one of my best friends, who go to different colleges. I'm getting fairly comfortable with my roommate and other people in my dorm, though, so I think I'm getting more able to talk with them about emotions.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes, it is a weird kind of pressure. It's fairly well acknowledged at my school, though, and I know I'm not alone in it. People call it the duck syndrome: it looks like someone has their life together and is floating easily along on the surface, but underneath they're paddling furiously. I don't feel it that often, and there are people in my dorm that I feel comfortable saying that I'm not great to. There's one girl in particular who can tell if I seem stressed and asks me to tell her more about what's going on.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Ok, I will let you know! I've been meaning to finish it but I haven't had time alone in my room. I will do it now though.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Well, it's a little difficult in my dorm because there aren't any full-length mirrors that I can easily use. However, it was good to try to take a look at my stomach and legs nonjudgmentally which I don't do on a regular basis because of the mirror size.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"That was useful, yes. I didn't get reminders, though, so I didn't do it as frequently as the program suggests.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm home for three weeks. I've been doing pretty well so far, but I think a different challenge at home is having food always available nearby instead of in the dining hall.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,The cognitive reframing technique just helped me a lot. I really liked that. Sometimes I get too caught up in the worries I have and don't take the time I need to step back and see if it's really that important.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes, sorry about that. I've been busy and didn't make the time to do the program. I'm doing well on not slipping into old habits, on the whole. I'm back at school now, and so far I've made healthy choices for the most part.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Dawn! I was on my dorm's ski trip this weekend, so I am just now getting the chance to do today's activities. Yes, I think the things I've been focusing on more at school translated pretty smoothly to home. They were applicable because instead of having a buffet of dining hall food available to me, there was lots of holiday foods, which aren't the healthiest. I did an overall good job of thinking about what I really wanted and eating less healthy things in moderation. I think one of the things that is sticking with me most is taking a breath and recollecting myself before making decisions and when I'm stressed. I think the most prominent roadblocks are letting down my guard, so to speak, when I'm in social situations. I think I would like to integrate the cognitive reframing tool into those pauses to breathe and think. In terms of my binge behavior, I think I have gotten better at being able to stop myself from continuing to binge even if I lose control for a short while. I can't see the rest of your message because my reply is covering it up, so I'll continue this reply in another message.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think the logical error that happens most for me is fortune telling. I think too much about what may happen or how something I don't want to happen, like being stressed or having to cram to finish something, seems inevitable. When this happens, I think I tend to have a narrower view of reality and not be the best at making good decisions. The next time a thought like this comes up, I really want to focus on breathing and break out of that narrow perspective by looking at the bigger picture. The performance went really well! I had fun and needn't have been stressed about it. I have been trying to focus on hydrating when I feel hungry or just out of sorts. I always have water bottle with me, so I've been doing pretty well with that. This week, I would be available to talk to you tomorrow sometime between 3:30 and 6:30 PST, and on Tuesday between 10:30 and 3. Wednesdays are really busy for me, but I could do Thursday between 12 and 3 or Friday after 11:15 PST. What would work for you?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Dawn! I'm sorry I've been so not on top of lantern recently. Winter term is turning out to be really busy. I'm doing well so far, though. My hip had been hurting over winter break, so I took a complete break for running for a while, but now that I'm slowly building up running again with other exercise on non-running days I'm feeling good because I really like running, which also affects my eating and mood in general.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Things have been going quite well! My birthday was last week, and I feel really positive about the coming year. I am definitely still working on my goals of being more aware and conscious of what I'm eating, which helps. I've also been trying to not be hard on myself when I do slip up, which contributes to the overall positivity.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"This week is dead week, next week is finals, and the week after is spring break. I'm taking a one unit geology class that's going to Death Valley, which I'm super excited for. I think it will be a low-stress environment with lots of time outdoors and cool things to engage with and put normal school time into perspective, so I think it shouldn't be triggering in terms of eating. Yes, overall I have been feeling more in control and pleased with my progress. The past couple of days have been so-so in terms of eating, but on the bright side I have been making time to do destressing activities, like running, swimming, and reflecting on the quarter with friends.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also, having a neutral third party tracking my progress is helpful and helps separate my progress from my judgment. The coach aspect is especially helpful in this regard.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Sure, my messages can be used for the presentation! Healthy Body Image has helped me have a really strong, thought-out structure for being more comfortable with myself both physically and emotionally. It also gives me maintain my goals and give me support to stay focused on them. Having a stable, continuous mindset for approaching my relationship with food and my emotions makes it easier to stay on track and have a consistent set of strategies to get closer to my goals.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Death Valley was great! Pretty hot, but beautiful. Eating went pretty smoothly. I tried to eat intuitively because I was in a different environment and different food options. It worked fairly well. I don't have too many concerns for transitioning back to school. I'm planning to use to the weekend to figure out how I can manage my time better this quarter and manage my stress levels/potential triggers better as a result.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes, I've been planning and it's been working pretty well. It definitely keeps me more focused on what I need to do and make sure that I try to give myself adequate time to do things. I think I want to try and make shorter-term goals for each day, though, so that I'm reminded of why I should follow my plans in the big picture.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Small goals are definitely working, but I'm still trying to figure out how to best remind myself of the larger goals I'm working towards as motivation to follow through with the small ones. I've noticed that I make decisions to follow or not follow those small goals consciously, which changes how I eat. My eating habits are going pretty well for the most part. I'm continuing to try to avoid my trigger foods and focus on eating when I'm hungry.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Phase 2 has been pretty good. I enjoy the focus on maintenance and things that I can do every day. It was a little annoying to have to track my moments of flow four times a day, but it was definitely helpful to take that time to reflect so frequently.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I think what has worked best for me so far is planning my eating goals the day before and reminding myself of my hunger level when I'm actually getting food. Writing down my goals is also really helpful.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,That sounds like a really good plan. Just taking a deep breath really helps when I remember to do it.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,This technique is something I've used recently a lot. I think it really helps for me on those days where I don't feel like giving it my all,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I did both. I have been using the tired calm meditation almost every night. I really like this one. I have been very focused on work lately and doing this before bed helps calm my kind so I can sleep. I haven't been eating so great lately. Since I am on the road 5/7 days of the week I haven't figured out how to continue eating healthy. I've Been so busy so I haven't thought too much about it, but I'm worried I will fall back in to old habits quickly if I don't figure out a plan quickly for this summer.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I am going to try to pause before ordering or deciding where I want to eat and just think about my choice. Like today at lunch I had an option to add a dessert for less than a dollar, and I paused for a minute, and decided against it. I didn't need dessert, my meal was plenty satisfying.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Wow! I can't believe it. I know I have been slow on my weekly check ins but honestly it's mostly been because I've been busy with work. In addition, When I was at my ""worst"" I felt like it was something I needed to do every day in order to feel better (which I did need to do) and as I've progressed, it never even crossed my mind as something I needed to do! I do many of the techniques or learned on a daily basis now anyways, and it has become my way of thinking without even realizing it! I feel so great right now with my body image I truly think this program worked wonders for me. I didn't lost a bunch of weight or get the picture perfect body but despite all that I look at myself in the mirror and truly like what I see. It feels good knowing that I have come so far. I'm Beth appreciative of your support and help and the program in general. Thank you so much, and I've felt very good about what I've been able to do through this program.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you! I'm finding it really helpful because my schedule right now is very busy, so It helps to plan ahead so I don't have to even question eating something healthy. It also helps so I'm not thinking about food all day, my meals are already planned",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Breaking down the situation after the fact helps me realize where I could have changed the situation. I'm hoping by doing this it can prevent it from happening in the future.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I would like to try to reach out to my friends and family for support. Up until now, I have never felt that I needed support from others. I thought I could change on my own. I thought that I needed to change on my own. I have tried before to give small hints to my sister, my girlfriends, and my boyfriend, about how I am feeling and what I am dealing with. It has never amounted to anything--most of the time they brush off what I say, and don't take me seriously, at which point I don't bring it up again. It frustrates me that I'm finally trying to reach out for support, and I'm not being taken seriously. Do you have any advice on how to bring up the situation so that they understand I'm being serious, and need their support in order to improve?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Oh no! I tried doing my check in on my phone and It didn't work very well!-- I didn't engage in any compensatory behaviors.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I had a great weekend!,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think this week, the best thing that I've done was trying to stick to the 3 meals and 2 snacks a day. I've really struggled with this in the past where I want to eat, pretty much all the time. There's still room for improvement, but I think I'm doing well with this. 

I really like the breathing strategies specifically the 4-7-8 one. I've used it a lot already for many things besides eating. I can get frustrated easily and even one round of 4-7-8 has helped me stay calm-- I have really like this. I think I'm going to try to use it more during times when I feel like I want to binge, or eat because I'm bored. I would like to improve this area of my eating habits-- I think using the breathing exercise could at least help me settle my thoughts and make a logical decision instead of a rash one. I will try this the next time it happens. 

As far as weighing myself weekly, I was hesitant to commit. I used to weigh myself way too much, and would get so frustrated because of how much my weight would fluctuate even in a day-- I never felt results. and then I stopped all together which led to me never knowing if I was gaining or losing, or staying the same. I have committed to weighing myself weekly. the number on the scale honestly scares me. I am intimidated by it, and often am ashamed of it. So my goal is to try to not let that number influence my way of thinking about myself. But to use it as a tool to help understand my body more. I hope to use it as a positive tool, instead of a negative. 

Overall, this week seemed pretty good for me, I felt better emotionally than I did last week, and I hope to continue to feel even better.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Didn't get the chance to really try the mirror mirror technique. It said to wait and do it when I was feeling good and hadn't just eaten a meal. So I'm holding off on that technique until I get a good time to do it.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,The first time wasn't that difficult. I think it will be more helpful in situations where I feel like binging for example.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I think the opposite action technique is one that I should have started using a while ago. I think it A.) helps to take my mind off the negative emotion I am feeling and B.) gives me a perfect solution for handling that negative emotion.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think at the gym I often compare myself to others and get down on myself despite the fact I am doing something positive for my body.

I might do this by doing something at the gym I know I am improving on, or am good at.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

I went out to eat a lot because of various events, and the at home I would end up eating dinner, and then keep eating until I went to bed. I started to feel really crappy. Even last night I ate dinner, and the ended up ordering take out before I went to bed. Every now and then I get like this, where I feel like I've lost a little control. I woke up today and decided I will do some of the techniques we practiced early on in the program to try to get back to a place where I feel I have more control.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm still here. My laptop has been out of commission the past few weeks so it's been more difficult to log on. I talked to Bianca on the phone and she was able to send me the link to the app. For some reason I had two and it wouldn't work. So for now I will keep doing it through the app until my laptop is back. I have been really good the past few weeks. Yet very busy. I've been feeling a little stressed as I prepare for graduation. Additionally, I have a job for after graduation and have been in and out of training for it. It's going to be a lot of work and I'm very nervous for how busy and stressed I will be this summer",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Yes it does. I can definitely work on not purchasing food for my pantry that's unhealthy. I'm in college, though, and one of the tough things is unplanned snacking that occurs because there's always random food lying about! I want to try to not overindulge on those things.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Thanks for the longer message check-in Jaqcui. I was nervous about weighing myself once a week, but have tried it before. I have noticed that my weight goes up/my eating behavior worsens in the days following a weighing, especially if I have lost weight. This was true for last week for sure, but has been less true for this week (I was up a pound). Overall, I think it's a good strategy, because it should be a more neutral activity than it is for me right now. I think one of the reasons my eating worsens after I lose weight is part of me feels I can ""relax"" or just eat unhealthily because my body can take it now that it has lost weight. This is probably part of the reason my weight has overall stayed constant while at school. (I gained a 7 or 8 pounds at the end of August, and wanted to lose it when I came here but haven't been able to.) I would really like to implement the breathing exercises, but haven't yet! I will try them for sure, especially when I get the urge to binge. Yesterday around lunch time I had a bad binge, and felt very ashamed afterwards. When it was over, I had an introspective moment with myself, which helped. I reminded myself how much choice I really have with eating, and that I don't have to eat anymore than I want to. This helped last night, because I told myself that I didn't want to eat after dinner, and didn't. It was empowering in a way. I tried completing my lantern activity last night, but it wouldn't work for some reason. Thanks for the message, and I look forward to trying out the new activities this week.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks for the big update email, I look forward to receiving those. I will respond to your questions (which I think will be really good for me to seriously reflect on) tomorrow!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you Jacqui! Sorry for delayed response- the self-esteem exercise wasn't super surprising, but it was good to reflect on where my self-esteem comes from, and it was especially interesting to think about how those sources affect my eating behavior/navigation through tough situations in general. I don't think I have an answer for that yet. I just logged in to the online forum- no major activity yet, right? Happy Halloween to you! Also as a note, the binging that I reported for today (Thursday night) was for lunch, when I wanted more lunch even though I was full and ate more, and didn't enjoy it. I had candy and other sweets at night during trick-or-treating, but not too much, and it wasn't out of control, so I'm not calling that one a binge.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My weekend was great! I didn't complete the mirror mirror exercise in entirety, but the little that I did made me feel really nice. I stopped objectifying my body as much, and looking at it as a whole unit instead of disparate parts. I'm hoping to complete the exercise tomorrow, and I'll let you know how it feels!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi! So the information definitely was important, but contained things I already believed. It was good in that it served as a reminder, but I didn't take a lot of new information from it! Also, I think the planned eating forbidden foods exercise has really helped me- it is making me crave the food less because I know that I can have it. Definitely still working through the process, but I already feel better about it!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"This week has been interesting for me. I've definitely been feeling better about eating in general, and I'm trying to figure out what is an appropriate amount of ""unhealthy (low nutrient) food"" to eat. I haven't been exposed to lots of unhealthy food this week in general, so part of me feels lucky. I trust that the work I've been doing for these past weeks has been helping. Thanks for all of your support!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Jacqui! So the exercise itself was cool to go through. At the moment I participated in the activity I wasn't feeling any particularly strong emotions. It will be nice to continue to stop myself throughout the week and assess my emotions, especially when I'm around food!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Jacqui- I ate a bunch of chex mix and popcorn tonight. This was especially sad for me because I had gone for over a week without a real binge. This one wasn't terrible, I just ate more than I should have and didn't want to stop. I've reflected on it, and I've identified some possible problems. One was that I wanted to not eat refined sugar for a few days just to try it, and I think the restriction made me crave food. Also I missed normal dinner in the dining hall because I went to an event, so I wanted to eat more this evening even though I knew I wasn't hungry (almost- you didn't eat full dinner, so it's okay if you have snacks right now). Yeah.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Great- thanks for bringing it to my attention Jacqui. Also, for reference the binge I reported today was a desire I had last night to eat more than I was hungry for. I ended up having a big dinner and just wanted sweets afterwards- it wasn't like other binges that occur over longer periods of time.

I hope you are having/had a great weekend yourself!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,I find that I'm more cognizant of moments when I check specific parts of my body. The exercise is good at helping me look at my body holistically!,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Um, I don't really know what to call it. I was pretty full and just wanted to eat more food. I was in a binge mindset because I irrationally wanted food, but was in part limited by the food options I had available- I couldn't bring myself to eat too many of the snacks in my room (which is why I had two pieces of candy) and I didn't want to take too many of the public cookies. It was more the mindset/drive that upset me when I reflected on the day, not the actual quantity of food I consumed.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hey Jacqui! As an update: I have been a vegetarian for the month of November (because it's good for the planet) and it's been really fun! I think I may continue past November. Anyway, the past week has been pretty good eating wise. I didn't have any binges while at home or during my travels, which was great. I have been feeling pretty balanced. You may notice from the cognitive restructuring activity that I did tonight that one of my worries is falling back into the behavior of binging because it happens so fast.
I hope you had a great Thanksgiving as well!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also, your feedback has been really encouraging. You're right, I remember that when I started the program I was having a couple really bad binges a week, whereas now they're less frequent and less intense. I think practicing will definitely help, and begin mindful in the moments when I eat. Also not eating as many sweets (and being really cognizant when I do eat them) has decreased my desire for them. They're not as good when I take away my obsessive ideas about them. (For example cookies are less of a temptation after taking a mindful bite and realizing that the cookie isn't that great/worth lots of mental strain.) 
I still have lots of work to do, but I'm definitely feeling better than before",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I have to work on balancing not avoiding food and not eating in excess.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks for the good wish on studying! And as a note, I didn't actually binge today, it was yesterday. It was very much a response to stress (which it usually isn't/never has really been). I'm not currently emotionally distressed about it, but I want to return to healthy habits. There's a lot of unhealthy food lying around right now because of the holidays.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I understand the theory of what you're saying, just not the actual fact in this instance- I still think that overeating over a long period of time will make me overweight, and that this whole situation would make me unhappy. I will continue to try cognitive reframing, though.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Jacqui! Sorry for the lapse, I traveled and am back home in Connecticut again! Choosing healthy options is a good goal for me, especially now that I'm at home. I have a lot of control over what I eat here because I make most of it myself! Eating poorly/excessively thus takes more effort, so it's a good environment for me to practice mindful eating/forming good habits. I hope you stayed dry in the storm!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Still not working! I'll keep checking each day. Thanks for all of your help Jacqui :),,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Wow, the program is almost over! I would really like to have another conversation with you sometime soon.

,,,,"Hi Jacqui! So sorry to have been absent for so long. I am realizing now that I really would not like to continue with the Lantern program. I think it would be best for continuing to work towards my eating goals to not do these check-ins anymore. It's similar to the weigh-in thing- the added anxiety/thoughts around reporting my eating cause me to overthink my eating and eat poorly. When I'm not thinking about my eating as much, I experience less problems with it. Could I possibly unenroll?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think a final phone conversation would be great! That way I can tell you how I'm feeling and we can discuss best strategies moving forward. Really I've just noticed that when I am not thinking about eating actively, (and am not actively naming things like binges, etc) I eat very well. My eating patterns are worse when I think about it/am more preoccupied with my eating. Would Sunday or Monday some time work for a conversation with you?",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Melody! I like the idea of writing positive statements like that on index cards. I've also heard of people writing something positive each day (for example, something they are grateful for) and putting it in a ""gratitude"" jar :) Anyway, I've really appreciated your help so far. I have a question about the program- when I fill out my ""checkin"" each day, there's always something about sending me a reminder. Do you know if this is supposed to be via email? Also, should I continue to check in on the Lantern website every day, like I've been doing?",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Melody! Not to worry :) I hope you're doing well! Things are good on my end. Thanks to the things I've learned in the HBI program, I've felt much more at peace in my relationship with food. I got your email- thanks a lot! I will get back to you as soon as I can :)",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Melody! Thanks for the feedback on the system- I'll be sure to check it next week. I just read your email, and would love to chat on the phone with you! Unfortunately, I will be in class during the three times you listed. Are there any other times you're available? I can suggest some too, if that works better.
Now that I've been in the program for a while longer, I've re-thought my intention for HBI- I went back to the earlier session and filled it in. Here's what I wrote: ""My intention for this program: I want to be able to take better care of myself, because I deserve that, but there's always that little mean voice in my head which says otherwise. I also want to do this because I should speak as kindly to myself as I do to my mother, sisters and friends. Lastly, I want to be a solid support system and role model for my younger sisters- as they grow up, I hope they won't take society's pressures on body image to heart."" Lastly, with regard to tracking what I'm eating, it's hard to predict what I'm going to eat in advance, since I'm in college and on a meal plan. Is there any way I could fill it out retroactively instead? For example, saying at the end of the day what I ate that day, instead of stating what I plan on eating tomorrow? Thanks, Melody, and take care! (Also sorry this was long!)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Melody! Thanks very much for your message. I definitely will plan to use my goals as motivation- I think they are such important goals, so that helps a lot!

Please let me know if any of these times work for you. Take care!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Melody! I hope you're well. I'm been reflecting on your feedback message- thank you so much, it was really helpful! You asked me some great questions and I'll try to answer them here.
I definitely agree that I've seen positive change this past week. My body image still is not great, but it's improved significantly! And I know that change does not happen overnight, so I'm very happy with my progress so far. Additionally I've been kinder to myself, and have been focusing on having ""me"" time. Self care is so important. I had an important midterm this week and had to study for it very hard, and felt like I had limited time to practice self-care, apart from short study breaks and getting a good night's sleep. Some other self-care strategies I'd like to try is reading outside and getting fresh air. I also like to listen to ocean waves (they have soundtracks online!) and relax with a friend, maybe watch a good show. I definitely think that integrating my care improves my mood and makes me feel less stressed.
My only concern regarding this past week is how I deal with high-stress situations. I think I mentioned to you that I have purged in the past, but infrequently (it isn't a clinical eating disorder). I've taken a step back to analyze my triggers. I've learned that it happens when I am in high-stress situations and I feel like I can't control the outcome. This was the case with my chemistry midterm.
I think you're completely right that being flexible with eating is so important. I've gotten very good at that over the past year :) There was a time about a year ago where I did have ""strict rules"" but that's not the case anymore. I've learned to let myself enjoy treats and be more flexible.
I do have a quick question- I don't see a link to the discussion board on my home page. Could you help me figure out how to access it?
One last thing I'd like to mention- I've enjoyed yoga very much over the past four years and am seeking to deepen my practice this upcoming summer. I might do a yoga teacher training! :) I think yoga is an amazing way to practice self-care. Melody, thank you for everything you do. I am so grateful for your advice. I hope you have a lovely weekend!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

Home is in Lebanon :) but also in Minnesota- I was raised in both places. My siblings and I attended school in Lebanon but spent our holidays with family in Minnesota :) I'm really excited for the upcoming holidays!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Melody! Nice to hear from you! I'm doing well. I'm actually back at school now in California, preparing for finals. It was lovely to be at home. Are you having a good trip?
Also, thanks for the feedback from last week! I've reflected quite a bit and realized that my unhealthy behaviors only surface when I am dealing (emotionally) with stress or anxiety- I think it's my way of trying to control things in my life. I really do feel like I've improved a lot! The techniques we've learned, especially mindfulness and grounding practices, have helped a lot with these emotions. I also think my body image has gotten a lot better. I've noticed a significant decrease in negative thoughts about my body.
Take care and I'll check in soon :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Melody! Sorry for the delay- I just finished my finals (phew) and flew to Minnesota to be with my family for Christmas. All is well! I appreciate your feedback, and here are some thoughts :)
I think it's great that the program has focused on emotions this past week- It's really a critical part of these issues. For me, I think the key emotion to regulate is stress/anxiety. I don't cope well with uncertainty in my life (and there's a lot of that in college) but this program has taught me so much in how to deal with that better! I've really appreciated the grounding exercises as well as the mindfulness. That, along with a regular yoga practice, helps keep me grounded. Additionally, I've really come to a place where I think positively about my body- almost with no conscious effort! I've learned so much and I think I've internalized that my body is deserving of the love I show to others. 
Hope you're well and having a great holiday season!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Good morning! I'm doing well, really enjoying my time with my family. I've got another week of break, and I'll be sure to make the most of it! I am looking forward to being back to my normal eating schedule and habits. During the holidays, there are always lots of family meals and parties with more indulgences than usual. I'm very happy with myself because I haven't binged or had any compensatory behaviors, I'm accepting that this is normal during the holidays. I hope you are well too!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks for your positivity, Melody! Hope you're having a wonderful start to 2015 :)",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Melody! I actually do. One of my resolutions is not to make a weight resolution :) instead, I want to pursue activities that make me feel good, and I want to continue respecting my body as I've been doing (that means no purging). Luckily, I haven't engaged in any of those bad behaviors recently and I don't feel the urge to! Another resolution is to refer back to the techniques I've learned, in times of distress. I'm thinking especially of Opposite Action. It really works and it really makes a difference to identify emotions!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Good morning! Thanks for the feedback- you're absolutely right about that. 2015 so far has been GREAT for me and my body image. Melody, I can't emphasize to you enough how much better I feel!

,,,,"Hi Melody! Thanks for your note! I've found cognitive reframing to be very helpful as well. I hadn't realized until now how common logical errors are, and now I'm equipped to address them! I have caught myself catastrophizing in the past couple days, and am quick to rethink and rephrase the thought. I thought the exercise was very helpful because it produced a palpable difference in my anxiety level. Also, I think people are more likely to believe ideas when they produce them (as opposed to hearing them from other people). It's my impression that cognitive reframing is so effective simply because I myself am the one realizing what my logical errors are- it's internalized. I hope that makes sense! As always, thank you so much for the encouragement :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Also- the only barrier I can think of is forgetting to use cognitive reframing in the moment. I have to train myself to remember to catch myself in a logical error.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Melody! Thanks for your message. I think I'll stick to the web version for now. In terms of reflections, I think I've made great progress so far!

,,,,"Thanks for reaching out to tech support on my behalf! 
I really appreciate your support, Melody. I did reach out to my school's counseling services this week- it was helpful to have a constructive conversation about grief. I feel very supported by my loved ones and I've decided to withdraw from a class to give myself more space to heal. :)
I'll try to get started on today's session if the tech issue allows. Hope all is well with you!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hey Melody! I'm doing well, how are you? I did find the core beliefs tool helpful, and I've been reflecting on it and journaling recently. I've definitely noticed these thoughts and have been able to catch them in the moment. They come up for me when I am feeling overwhelmed or anxious- not when I am relaxed and at ease. I can keep them at bay by reminding myself that they aren't true. I think the logical error in these thoughts, for me, is ""you aren't good enough"". I can fight these feelings of inadequacy by surrounding myself with loving, positive people and by keeping a gratitude journal or post-it collection. It's a work in progress! Hope you're well. Have a great weekend.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Melody! Thanks for your note. I'd say a couple new goals I have are to continue having positive thoughts towards myself and towards my body image, and also to remind myself that little progress is still progress- it's okay to face setbacks.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,Hi there! Thanks for checking in- I actually was going to ask something. Does it seem (on your end) that I'm doing phase II right? There are some days where the program is just a 1-minute anxiety check-in. Just wanted to ask if that's how it's supposed to be! Take care :),,,,,none,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi Melody- that makes a lot of sense. Thank you for explaining that to me! I understand Phase II a lot better now. I'll let you know if I have feedback but for now I'm happy to keep using the skills I've learned so far!,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi there! Yes- I can think of a couple! A few techniques that have really stuck with me are meditation, practicing mindful eating, and gratitude. I've found that I am able to think kindly about myself when I take time to appreciate the things in my life. I also often think about cognitive reframing and correcting logical errors. That particular technique has been really helpful for me because my negative core beliefs are what have lead me in the past to disordered eating habits. I feel empowered and able to address those core beliefs by correcting my automatic thoughts and logical errors. I try every day not go dramatize or overgeneralize and it does help! I also have used Dear Body a few times since I learned it, and it helps me reframe how I think about myself. Overall I try to practice self-soothing activities. I've discovered recently that it's especially important for me to get enough sleep. I am not sure why, but I am more likely to have sugar cravings and overall be more emotional when I'm not getting enough sleep. So I'm trying to make that I priority! I hope you have a great weekend!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Thank you Melody! I appreciate that! I hope you're doing well :),,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi there! Those findings really tell me what I suspected- sleep is so important for my health. I'm making an active decision to make sleep a priority a few ways- I've decided to get in bed by 11 or 11:30 and spend some time reading. I know my body needs at least 8 hours. I'm also trying to get homework done early in the day to free up my evenings and leave some time for relaxation :) Take care!,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi there! Phase II has been good for me so far. I think it's good that it's less of a commitment than Phase I. I really learned a lot in Phase I and I catch myself using the techniques every day. Phase II has been especially useful because it builds on the previous techniques. I really liked the session on Gratitude Science today. Just to clarify, are there three phases total?",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Melody! It's great to hear from you! I've honestly gotten everything out of this program that i set out to accomplish initially. I vaguely knew that i wanted to practice mindfulness, gratitude, body acceptance, and other techniques, and this program really solidified that knowledge for me! I can't think of any other topics I wanted to learn about, but i'll let you know if i do. I will definitely try to reflect on why i am grateful for things!

,,,,"Hi there Melody! Thank you for the well wishes- it's been a good week so far! I've spent some quality time with good friends :) I hope you are doing well too! The meditation activity was great for me- I find that it really helps me find clarity and calm! As for resiliency, I've found that the way I was raised really contributes to my approach in dealing with setbacks. My parents introduced variety in my life and taught me to adjust to new situations and new circumstances. One of my favorite sayings is that it's okay to stretch and be a little out of your comfort zone! I think this mentality contributes to resilience. As for how bouncing back from setbacks.. that's a good question. i think for me the biggest barrier to bouncing back from setbacks is when I get too emotional over something. it can prevent me from thinking clearly and rationally. One way to fight that is to channel those emotions somewhere- reading, writing, drawing, exercising, talking about it with a friend :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

One of my problems was I had a really bad throat and couldn't eat much so that drastically reduced what I could eat which in turn zapped my energy.

I have to do these exercise labs that are suppose to gauge how healthy we are and on it's own that wouldn't be so bad, but I have to then do this worksheet that shows how aware of out of shape I am how I need to be at a certain level and really reinforces all the negative thinking that I have worked so hard to quit doing. I feel like this Kineseology class is really kind of almost this programs opposite. I put off doing my work till as late as possible, but I have to remember all this stuff for my test. It just really makes me sad and I have to work so much harder not to back track.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I have been really trying to take time and reflect whenever I am tempted to binge. I am trying to identify the ""why"" I want to eat. I have been doing better with exercise. Whenever I go to campus I park in the parking lot that is furthest away from the building I need to go to. My kids have had so many after school activities lately that a family walk is a bit harder to schedule. But I am still planning on doing it. One technique that I have found to be absolutely wonderful for stress relief is the breathing exercise that was on one of my day sessions this week. I even got my husband to try it and he likes it.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

It is time I practice what I preach. I am learning so much through this program! While I do find that some of the exercises are difficult they are working. I am noticing improvements in myself when I am around people, I was even in class one day and wasn't self conscience. Small victories do add up! I have been working very hard on ending my binging. Places that I am having the most problem not binging is when we go out to eat. My families favorite places are mostly buffets. They are the most cost effective for our family of four. Do you have any tips for how I can still eat out but not binge? Thank you!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Thank you Dawn I will sure try that. I work the same crazy schedule Tuesday so I will get some small snack I can have in my backpack that I can eat while on my way to class.

,,,,"Dawn I have encountered a new problem scenario I could use some advice on. I work for the Child Development Center on campus and sometime (actually quite a bit lately) I am working past lunchtime. While most of the time there is lunch available, I have not been having time to eat it. After we get the children fed we put them down for a nap. We have been having trouble getting them to sleep. So when we do finally get them to sleep, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I have to go to class. After my class is over I then go home. By the time I get home it is almost 2:30 and I try to eat something small, but I am really hungry at this point. If I try to eat something small then I am watching the clock all afternoon until it is finally dinner time. Then I eat too much. If I eat a small meal when I get home I am not really hungry at dinner time, however I do eat dinner. I feel like I am eating to much even though I may not eat very much at dinner. I would appreciate your advice. Laura",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Dawn,
I have been thinking a lot about holiday eating lately. On top of Thanksgiving and Christmas, I have 2 birthdays in December! I think that my strategy is going to be small portions of the food that is at Thanksgiving. If I don't at least try everything that is offered I am afraid I am going to feel like I shorted myself and that never ends well for me. I am also only going to have one plate. The desserts are what stresses me most. I have a killer sweet tooth and I this is the time of year when all my favorite desserts are made. Christmas is even worse when it comes to all the available sweet things. Thanksgiving first, do you have any suggestions for how I can survive the dessert table?",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Dawn
Unfortunately I have to report I was unsuccessful in controlling myself yesterday. I went in with a good plan, but when it came time to execute my plan I completely failed. I am not really sure what happened. In December besides Christmas I also have two birthdays to put on not to mention all the dinners and things. I am a little nervous since I was unsuccessful yesterday.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Dawn I just today had an opportunity to use my breathing and relaxation techniques to help me avoid binging. I had to see a specialist today and while the doctor tried to keep me positive there still is potential for there to be something very wrong going on with my body. When I got home the first thing I wanted to do was go to the fridge and dive in. I managed to sit myself down and do some breathing and grounding exercises and managed to avoid a binge. I have to say that this is the first time that I have managed to avoid binging when I am this stressed. I think I can call that a victory. As far as Thanksgiving went however, I went in with a plan and then got to my Mother-in-laws house and kinda lost focus. All I could think about was my favorite holiday foods and so were most of the people in my family. Thanksgiving and Christmas are two of the hardest holidays to not overindulge. However, I am going to rejoice in my small victory today and move forward.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

On top of that my husbands birthday was yesterday. It went well and we had fun though. Now things should even out for a while at least. I hope your week is going well.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Dawn, I think I did better at this birthday party because I went into it with the knowledge that I was going to overeat. I think that by knowing that I was going to overeat, it took a lot of pressure off of me and I think that I ate less than I would have if I would have stressed myself out about watching everything I put in my mouth at the party. It's kinda funny how that works. I think that will definitely be my strategy for Christmas.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Dawn, I had a nice holiday for the most part. I am glad it is over not from the perspective that it was unpleasant, but from the perspective that temptations will be less and I will be able to stay on track much easier. I have never noticed how much the Christmas and New Year's holiday revolved around eating before. Now I can refocus on upcoming challenges and continue on with progress.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think that is some great advice. I think focusing more on why my friends and family gather around the holidays are much more beneficial than what we will eat! My next big challenge will be our annual Superbowl party. Food is pretty much left out and eaten during the whole game. I think that my best bet will be, when I go to eat I will just take single bits worth of things that way I will not continue to binge over and over again. I think that maybe a outdoor activity during half time would be good to plan with the family too. Any suggestions? Thank you so much Dawn!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Sorry Dawn I completely forgot and I would love to help anyway I can. 

This program has been a wonderful life changing help to me. When I first started the program I was skeptical and thought that it was probably just another diet program and a waste of time. But since it was free I thought why not? What do I have to lose? What I have learned has been more valuable that I ever could have imagined. I have gone through the first phase of this program and it has given me skills to not only understand my eating disorder, but it has helped me understand my triggers and how to deal with numerous situations. My coach has been with me through every step of my recovery process. I have a more positive self image which has given me more confidence. I am so thankful that this program was made available to me through the University where I attend. This has been an answer to prayer and a gift that there are not enough ways to say ""thank you"" for. It is my wish that this type of program totally replaces current health class standards. I am currently taking a Health class through my University and I find it more harmful than a good thing. The processes through this program have helped me work through issues and get past them so that I feel like I am worth getting better. Current health classes focus more on the outward appearance of people and it is my opinion a philosophy like that is not helpful to anyone. 

I hope that helps. Sorry I forgot.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

Things have been going okay I suppose. It seems like this time in the semester things really get busy, but I still have family things to take care of as well. I have been unable to find a job and I may have to wait until closer to next semester to find one, so that is a little added stress right now. I have been trying not to get on the instant messaging because I know that I am suppose to learn how to handle these things on my own. The past couple of weeks have been bumpy and so has my habits. I unfortunately regressed back into kicking myself for stuff, which I know is not helpful. I think that today's technique is pretty wonderful. Stopping to be thankful has changed my perspective a bit. I really thought that I had a handle on self-talk and again I let my guard down and there I was kicking myself again.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Sarah-- I just had a chance to read through your feedback from last week in detail; thanks a lot! I think a lot of my anxiety comes down to a few things: 1) being on time and sticking to a schedule, 2) worrying about how my boyfriend and mother will react to things and judge me for them, and 3) how I am performing at my job and if it is the right fit for me. I think all of these might fit into the ""worry"" category, so I'm excited to keep using the worrying tool to address them. Otherwise, I still have anxiety-driven bodily sensations or reactions that I can't quite identify the cause of, so hoping to keep focusing and working on that going forward.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I've been forgetting about it a lot but recently I've been able to catch myself when I'm worrying and trying to delay it for worry time. I think that's a useful trick that I haven't been able to do before, so that's been good. I've also noticed that my ""worries"" and ""automatic thoughts"" are related--as in, I automatically assume the worst will happen, and then start worrying about it uncontrollably, even though none of it is really grounded in reality. While that is frustrating, I think now that I realize that I'm a little better able to control it and stop it. But still room to go...",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

Feeling a bit frustrated. Fortunatley today, my husband was able to take my daughter to school so that I have an extra hour to catch up, however at the time I ate the rice last night I didn't even think ahead to having my Hubby do the am school run.Looking back, I wish that I had thought of it last night during binge vs. the uncontrolled eating.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,Wow....Interesting Core Belief exercise today....hit home.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Overall this program has helped me to focus on my compulsive eating on a consistent daily basis. It has provided the education and terminology around automatic thoughts and I?ve appreciated having some direction in things to focus on and do approach differently.
The biggest thing that I?ve noticed is being more aware of when I start to eat compulsively. Sometimes I press on, but other times I take a few seconds/deep breaths and take the time to think about 1. If I?m truly hungry and if not, what feeling is causing me to feel anxious. Then I can take the time to address the feeling and issue. I feel so much better after taking the time and not overeating. It feels like I am in control and like a cloud the feeling moves along and I am not left with residual uncomfortable feelings. 
Some of the tools have been useful to calm my anxiety. I have used some of the breathing exercises on multiple occasions. I have also used cognitive reframing to beak down negative thoughts. 
Another aspect that has been positive for me, if that I have started to walk daily for at least 30 minutes. Being outside allows me to slow down, process my feelings and get outside of myself for a bit. I am still working on eating when I am hungry and do still have some times of the day especially at dinner time when binges tend to occur. However, I do feel that I am more aware and have some actions to take now. 
At this point I would like to reinforce what I have learned and have more practice with cognitive reframing.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,Hi Dani. Thanks for checking in.I missed doing sessions on the weekend because things were a little hectic. Is there a way to set up reminders? A phone call sounds great! This Sunday would be good for that.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,Ok thanks. Bingeing is always when I'm alone in the house. I'll mindlessly start eating in the kitchen and not even sit down and not stop until I'm incredibly full. Always processed food/ junk and I don't think about the calories (which I'm always thinking about otherwise) but I'm sure they are upwards of 1000-2000 at a time. When I was bulimic I would have 13000 calorie binges so I have come down a lot from that. However when I quit purging I gained weight and the bingeing keeps me from being able to return to my normal weight. If I don't have food at the house I'll go out and get fast food which is something I would never eat normally.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

He's really special and we're having a lot of fun, in a light and profound way. I appreciate these moments of pure pleasure and enjoyment; now that I'm out of my last relationship I'm giving myself permission to enjoy life. I feel like these amazing moments recharge my mental fortitude so I can gear up to work really hard and manage stress related to lots of end of the year work that needs to be done. I'm really excited in that the date isn't over yet - we have until the afternoon and we're going to visit the east bay for some hiking.

,,,,Thanks Sarah and great idea re finding a way to not procrastinate; I think I really just need to overcompensate by planning ahead way more than I do now and by always trying to get things started and done early as opposed to late. It should be boring as opposed to ridiculously challenging,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Really fun date who put me into being in the moment. All my worries melted away and I just focused on this great affection and pleasure. I also find little luxuries like taking the time to get dressed up and getting my nails done make life feel a little more special, like a reminder that it's not always going to be this crazy and what I'm working towards.

By accepting what my actual job is, it gave me quite a lot of peace.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Sarah, thanks for sending your feedback, I'm going to respond to your feedback from last week and this week!

from 11/17/14:
-anxiety on the 12th: I was at the warehouse in a lot of meetings, interaction w/ people re: work sometimes causes anxiety if it's a lot of stressful situations/problem solving. Also I was supposed to go on a date w/ A for his bday but he was being very slow to respond re: plans, which caused a lot of automatic thoughts around him not liking me, etc. 
-re: feeling overwhelmed I have narrowed my dating to just 2 guys, A and Chris, and that's way more manageable. A guy who I was obsessed w/ previously but I realize is SO not right for me is someone who I do phone calls w/ as a friend. 
-I am delegating a bit more, and that's definitely helping too. 
-I feel like I'm very confident in myself and the person that I am, and this dating cycle has shown me that people really adore and respond to me. So I don't fear/worry about being alone. 
-Work is probably 85% of the anxiety I feel - which is why I really need to buckle down and just get it done. There is a lot of planning/delegation, and once that is done I should actually be pretty relaxed. I am frustrated that I'm in this negative feedback cycle where I'm too stressed and paralyzed to just attack the situation head on. I have made this realization and today I set intentions to just knock things out, without any emotion.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm a little frustrated - every time I seem to have time to actually get interrupted work done, I feel compelled to distract myself by calling a boy or doing something to help me procrastinate. How can I stop being scared of work and just jump in? The more I procrastinate the more anxious I get",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also I realized that a big part of my drifting is Adam (my ex) is gone as my rock. Although he created more chaos and anxiety, which caused me to get less done than I am getting done now, he's still something missing from my life which was a little bit anchoring. I am really glad he's not in my life much anymore, but I do realize that he was a stabilizing force that I need to replace w/ myself or something else.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"re: feedback from 11/23/14: first of all thanks, for all the support! I actually had a moment of happy crying this morning, because I feel like I'm getting in touch with myself, and I was sort of mourning the fact that things have been so hard on me. Crying is a good way of me being honest w/ myself. I really look forward to getting things in my life under control, so I feel like I have breathing room and leisure, not always crisis mode. Physical cues for anxiety are mostly short of breath, sometimes when I think about what I need to do that I'm procrastinating on, that makes me anxious. Hard deadlines make me anxious too and I need to get ahead of the deadlines. I was always that student that crammed for exams and I'm realizing that I need to break those habits. Re: mantra, I think ""This would be hard for anyone, you've pulled through before and now you're going to go one step further and create a system to get all this under control. You can do it Joyce - just stay strong and focus!"" I know this is long but I feel like I do need a multi-part mantra. Chris, one of the 2 guys I'm dating more seriously right now said ""Don't forget to laugh and smile along the way."" I'm trying to keep that in mind, that I shouldn't take life so seriously.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Here's a playlist I made of ""Addicted to Love/Obsessed Songs""; pretty much all of these resonate w/ me",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I realized as I was doing headspace meditation on the anxiety track that we tend to get into patterns and feeling anxious is a comforting habit. I think I need to consciously feel disgust when I feel it, and also attack the root cause: I know that I practice avoidance of the cause of anxiety, which just leads to heightened anxiety. I need to just attack the source head on. Whenever I've focused and put my mind to doing something it's worked out just fine.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Very irritated Alan has still not gotten back to me re what our plans should be for our date tomorrow, I'm not going to reach out again and if he doesn't respond to my email I'll just going to assume things are cancelled.

There are plenty of guys who are willing to be responsive within seconds or at least minutes, not days",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Sounds good; I just recapped thurs/fri via lantern just now; Alan and I cleared up a bunch of misunderstandings and I'm even more into him than before. Have a great rest of the weekend and talk soon!,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

,,,,"I think I like the phone calls, because it's more interactive and we can iterate on things, so if that works for you we could even do every Tues 730pm if that works for you, lmk. If you have particular things you want to keep testing on me, happy to be the guinea pig - in general I feel pretty good so while I'll sometimes use Lantern as a life line when I'm beside myself, generally I see it as a really useful self improvement tool that will keep me in touch w/ myself.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"I have a lot to worry about this week - due to the Thanksgiving holiday last week our revenues were down by $20K or so (people out of the office so needing less product); we have some temp cashflow issues compounded by our accounting person being out through yesterday. It's a little stressful b/c I believe payroll is pulled tomorrow and it will be tight, but I'm using some techniques to just remind myself that there's a list of things we need to do but that it's very unlikely the company will go out of business, and that things will work out in the end. Interestingly enough, my anxiety level has not really gone up - I just know some stuff needs to be done to fix this.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey Sarah, here's the definition of love addiction I was reading about: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_addiction. They say it's triggered by being neglected at a young age; in the 2nd grade my mother went away for a year to get medical treatment in China. My dad isn't a very warm person, and I remember during that day feeling extremely bipolar - lots of lows and highs. My feelings of being so into someone that I feel ridiculously distracted seem to fit a bit in w/ love addiction, as well as my discomfort w/ being alone and always needing validation from others. I feel a little ambivalent about it though, in that last week I felt uncomfortable being alone, and this week I think I may be okay w/ it. Love addiction might also explain how I can fall in love so quickly - I am generally a lucky person but it feels a little unreal that there are 2 people I can see spending the rest of my life w/ in my life right now.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Another area I'm avoiding is I work from home way too much, since I feel overwhelmed at work and keep wanting to ""catch up"". Since Adam is exiting the company I need to have more face time w/ my employees to build relationships and loyalty - once I get more unburied I plan to do that a lot more. Wow work cut out for me!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Re: dating life, I really feel like Alan is very special, and Chris is a close 2nd. I feel really good about telling all the people I was hanging out w/ who I know aren't special to me that I don't want to see them anymore.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"thanks Sarah, and yes 6pm next Tues works, lmk best #. There is a tiny chance I have a client dinner that evening but most likely not - will keep you posted if anything changes!

What I find is that there are a lot of shades of grey in every situation, and seems to me like I have a lot of very light diagnoses of various things, but that by applying some techniques to rewire the way my mind works, I am able to get past things, recognize my unhealthy patterns and break them. I definitely don't have a lot of deep-seated traumas, and am a very optimistic person in general. Basically, everyone has various forms of issues, but most people including me don't have them to a clinical level. 

I'm starting to trust my feelings more, now that I feel much more recovered from the inevitable pain of breakup and separation.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"One thing I have been avoiding b/c it's terrible for my self esteem is talking to Adam. Every time I talk to him, he totally cuts me down. I do try to empathize b/c he's frustrated b/c he feels like I totally have the capability to be successful and plan ahead, but then I don't because I'm not very disciplined. I 100% agree w/ him that his assessment is true, but his disappointment and negativity really discourage me. I think I'll be able to have a conversation w/ him a bit later on down the line, once I've proved to myself and him that I can be the executive/co-founder that he wanted. The timing of course is really off because we'll both have moved on and we're not getting back together - we weren't really right for each other in the first place. We've been trying to fit the square peg into a round hole for so long. I am grateful for everything that has occurred - I am able to be a better person through these difficult times. I have to depend on myself. The gravity of the work situation has also enabled me to simplify my life and really focus; I am glad that I was able to dial my dating life back too. And anyway there are 2 guys I REALLY like, ie I feel right now that they could make me really happy all around.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also, Adam told me on the phone that his search for his next gig is going well, and that he's dating. I am happy to hear both, and truly only wish him the best in both. The fact that both of us have moved on rather quickly I think indicates that the breakup was really the right thing. One thing to keep in mind is ""Did we have an 8 yr relationship, or the same 1 yr of relationship growth 8 times?"" The truth is somewhere in between, really",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I still have access to Adam's calendar, and it's quite possible he's even dating a 50 yr old. The fact that I'm dating 28 and 30 yr olds seem to indicate that our world's really are rather different",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"great, talk to you then! Imaginal exposure is great - while in that space I get to the max stress level, and then I dig myself out by thinking about solutions/next steps. I am glad to be able to just face the fear, as opposed to perpetuate more fear by avoiding the situation.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,and thank you for all of your support!,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"yes re: love life, I am spending time w/ two really amazing guys who are giving me the love, affection, and compassion that my ex never did. It feels good, and my relationship w/ both is getting deeper. Pretty much I feel like I have 2 really great boyfriends right now. With that love in place, I no longer feel obsessed re: relationship, which I'm excited about b/c I can focus on my business more. I am also making a concerted effort to spend time w/ friends too.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"imaginal exposure is helpful, it helps me focus on solutions. The situational exposure is going to be interesting too; I did it for the first time today and that was easy because things are getting better in the ""not running out of money"" department",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Today was a good and really bad day. Adam flipped out and suddenly wants me to pivot/focus on something specific. He's right but he always makes me change directions so violently vs making gradual changes along the way. He would just say that I don't listen when he is subtle so he has to yell at me. I feel bad about myself because he's right there is a problem. I'm a little irritated because he can only watch from the sidelines but not fix the problem. Anyway I am working on it; getting caught up with stuff.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"thanks Sarah, hope you did too! Your feedback re automatic thoughts was pretty spot on; the entire argument Alan and I had last week was actually a miscomm where I missed some Google Chats from him where he actually did respond. So I ended up being upset w/ him for what I thought was not responding, when in fact he did - oops. Still loving all the hangout w/ both of my boys, retail stores doing well and will help us not run out of $. The only 2 bad things about the weekend are I didn't get all my desk work done, and I may have a small cold. Tonight although I wanted to hang w/ Chris again, I told him I needed to get work done. I'm going to use Mon night to catch up on work. What I think both boys don't really get is the scale at which my business operates and the fact that a few hours of work can result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue. Anyway, doesn't matter whether they know it or not; as long as I know it and stay focused and disciplined and don't let them jeopardize the health of the biz, that's fine.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Really happy with my love life right now, enjoying both chris and Alan. Chris and I seem to be getting a little more involved in terms of spending a lot of time together, admitting were really into each other and possibly more long term, etc. Alan too in that he expressed some feelings last week (he thought of me when he woke up and just imagined me there with him)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I just need to get work in gear - trying hard to stay focused. It's been a handful of days since I had time on my own not on dates or at chris place, so savoring being at my place and doing some decompressing. I love the luxury of reading the New Yorker.

,,,,"yes, I think I am going to get back to it. guess i just lost my motivation.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,I am so sorry my apartment flooded and I have been dealing with maintenance and carpet cleaners! The call completely slipped my mind. Can we reschedule?,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Could we do Monday at 3:30? Also I was thinking about starting a food journal. Not with calories or anything just keeping track of what I eat? Do you thinks that's a good idea or no?,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,When rating my body image I just see a sliding scale with no indication of which end is positive or negative? So I'm going to assume the far left is negative and the far right is positive!,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,It didn't go well. I went to eat with some friends and my sister but then they were talking about how fat they were ( when really they are probably half my size ) and they both ordered salads and I couldn't do it. I felt so bad and gross and guilty. So I ordered a salad and then came home and binged.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

As for your feedback from last week, I am currently using slimquick however I am almost out and I am not planning to buy anything else. We will see how that one goes. Also I really liked the meal planner because it sent me email reminders that popped up on my phone. Will it come back on my program?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I have been stressed over finals the past couple of weeks. Also I have been trying to compensate a little for Thanksgiving dinner and now Christmas dinner. That's why I haven't been eating as much. And when I do my emotional eating kicks in and then I over eat before I even realize what is happening.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,Thank you for the suggestion. I am currently seeing a counselor in addition to this program.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,Is the reframing supposed to make you more anxious than when you started?,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,With the reframing I find it difficult to come up with something I'm anxious about. In my counseling at adams I'm just starting to recognize when I am first starting to have anxiety so that I can turn it around instead of letting it overwhelm me.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Can sleep affect the way you eat?,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hey Dawn! My spring break doesn't start until Saturday, but I'm very excited about it. I would love to send a little message! The program is a major blessing in my opinion. I was in such a weird place, not knowing what to do about my body image issues because I didn't think they were severe enough to bother anyone with. But this program helped me realize that no matter how severe, it's still a problem and should be worked on. And it has been so extremely helpful. I learned so many different things, beyond just food, that contribute to body image that I would have never thought of. I also learned a lot of new and useful techniques so I know how to handle situations in which I'm very vulnerable or not thinking clearly. I definitely think that this program had helped me with my issues and helped me grow as a woman. I'm very thankful for the opportunity to be a part of it!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"hey Dawn! Spring break was so so so much fun. I went to California with some friends! I have never been there before so i was extremely excited. I LOVE the beach, so just being near one for a whole week made me such a happier person. I was able to enjoy the week without worrying about what i was eating or what i looked like. I didnt want that to get in the way of my trip, so i didn't let it! i'm surprised by how easy that was. One thing i noticed however was that my mood seriously tanked whenever i looked at pictures of myself. I suddenly became super critical and my mood turned bad after looking at them. I remember while taking the pictures i wasn;t thinking negative things at all, it was only when i looked at the pictures after the fact that my mood changed. Overall, it was a really great trip and much needed!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Dani! I think that because of the rebranding I was having a really hard time login in. I tried many many times but I had forgotten my password and the system wasn't letting me create a new one! I had to contact customer support to fix it, and I finally managed to access it again just now!!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Dani! My highest body image rating was the day of the winter formal. I got ready with a few friends, my dress was beautiful and tight and form-fitting, and everyone at the party told me how great I looked. It's good for the self-esteem when people you barely talk to compliment you on your looks haha but I don't have winter formals everyday, so that feeling isn't always there!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I agree. I know a put a lot of emphasis on how I look and how skinny I think I look and how puffy my cheeks look, but I value my intelligence a lot and it is definitely something that can make me feel better or worse about myself. I've found that when I do badly in exams - thus feeling kind of stupid - I also think I look fatter/uglier. During finals week I was very relaxed because I don't know (I was in a very weird zen state, ended up doing great in exams but worrying half as much) and my eating habits were very normal and I felt skinny. I've been on a family vacation for 5 days now and now I'm starting to stress out about my weight.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Weird zen state: I don't know, it's kind of hard to describe. I usually stress out too much during exams, and this time knowing that no matter what happened in the exams it still meant that the semester was over, and that I wasn't going to fail any classes, helped me relax. I guess it was the exact opposite of what usually happens. i was really relaxed, even when the night before my stats exam and got really sick because of a vaccine and couldn't really study.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi dani! Answering your two previous questions. Im home in Ecuador for the break and it's been an incredibly challenging time. Not only is it summer here, so it's beach time, but due to my new behaviors (that is, not purging often) I've gained 3 pounds. I'm usually 120-122 pounds all the time. When I'm at 116-118 is when I feel really good about myself. I'm currently at 125. I'm constantly moody and grouchy, I'm always surrounded by friends and it's so hard not to feel self conscious. I wonder if they're thinking how fat I look, or how ugly I look. I take pride in knowing people think I'm pretty. Feeling this fat (I haven't been 125 in 3 years) is really messing wth my head. So I don't really know what I can do about it, besides losing those 3 pounds, and a few more. I don't know how to do it in a healthy way though. I only know purging or not eating. So that's really challenging right now. My boyfriend is visiting Ecuador with me so he's been incredibly helpful. But I'm just a big ball of grumpiness. Help.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Dani,
I actually think I'm doing better now. I have a week where I was freaking out because of how fat I look. But every once in a while I realize that it's not really the case. I've been trying to eat healthy and I'm still freakingg out because I think I should be thinner. But the grounding exercise is really helpful. I breathe and think of things I can see and touch and hear, and I forget about everything else. I am still seeing a therapist and nutriologist, although I've been vacationing in Ecuador for 3 weeks ao I haven't had any appointments. I think it'll be good to be back in the US next week and see them again..",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Dani! I just landed in the US. As for feeling peaceful, hopeful, and appreciated, those days were my many goodbye dinners with family and friends. And I always enjoy spending time with them. My boyfriend was also particularly attentive during those days. So I was mostly just happy. Being in the US also makes me feel more relaxed about my weight. Since my parents aren't around to make me eat a lot I can go back to my meal plan and diet a little bit. I have an appointment with my nutritionist on Monday and I'm looking forward to it.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Dani! I actually really enjoyed it. I've noticed that what works the most for me is simply calming down, breathing, and focusing on other things. I really liked the mindfulness exercise mostly because it was also difference from the other ones. Instead of focusing on other things I was focusing on what does bother me and letting it go by breathing. Granted it was about feeling the sounds around me/what my body is touching/etc, but I like the idea of accepting that things are there and just letting them go. It was very relaxing and I'm looking forward to today's exercise!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"DANI THAT'S THE GREATEST NEWS EVER hahaha i think checking in will be SO much easier once I have the app on my phone. When I'm on my laptop I'm usually doing homework and then space out about other things.. so how convenient. I'll download it ASAP. 
As for tracking, I like it. I like thinking about what I've been doing the day/week before, because I'm not really actively thinking about how many meals I've had or how many times I've purged, even if I know i'm engaging in those behaviors. It kind of makes me take a step back and think ""wow I barely ate yesterday, how do i feel about it?"". I also just left a meeting with my therapist and I know I've been having problems, so I need to try to be more deliberate about checking in daily and talking to her weekly.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Dani,
It's so sad that you're stepping away! I understand however that you might need to for different reasons. I wanted to thank you for all your time helping me. This is definitely not easy but you have always made me feel like you're listening and have always been willing to help when I need it. As for Anna, it would be great if you could share with her whatever you think is relevant . The hardest part about talking to someone about this is usually the beginning, getting to know the person, etc. and it would just be easier to skip some of that! haha finally, I think a phone call on Friday would be great. You've been such a huge help during these past few months and have really been a part of me getting better. So thank you Dani!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi dani. So so sorry. Yes I do want to reschedule. I've had one of the worst weeks of my life, so I'm just kind of out of it. My boyfriend of three and a half years told me two days ago that he doesn't love me and would never marry me. Unrelated to go lantern, but it explains why I'm not myself right now and can't even get to do a daily session or my homework. My phone number is 2022129587. Let's reschedule, I do want to talk to you. Have an awesome weekend.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna! I apologize for replying so late. I've been going through a lot of personal things so I haven't really been in the mood for much.

,,,,"Hey Anna. My mind is so over the place lately I think I need more constant reminders. Things have been doing well, but it's still hard to concentrate. I've decided to refocus all the energy I wasted hating Steve into other things, and I seem to be far more relaxed now and not really care about him as much. That said, it's still hard at times, and it feels like a constant emotional roller coaster. As for classes, I feel like I'm pretty behind, and I'm a bit anxious about catching up in time for the final. I need to start focusing on my things again",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna! So I had been doing pretty well for about a month and a half. But because of the breakup I ended up losing a lot of weight (10 pounds). And now I feel weird. I'm very happy with my body, even if I know I lost the weight because I was sad. And I'm truly scared of regaining eat, so I find myself freaking out whenever I eat. That started happening earlier this week and it's at times difficult to control. I don't know how to be happy with my weight and allow myself to eat without feeling guilty",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna! As for your last message, you captured exactly how I'm feeling. I'm feeling quite happy about my body right now, and that creates all this anxiety about me gaining a few pounds. It means that after I eat I immediately fear that the weight will come back, so I purge. That said, purging also makes my face swell, and it freaks my out because it makes me feel chubby. I've been trying to avoid it, and I've been successful and not purging since Thursday. So yes, definitely higher takes now that I'm thinner.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"As for your last message, I do see the unexamined assumptions. I know that having one cookie won't make me gain weight. But I automatically get this ""well, I just ate a cookie. I might as well go all out and then purge"" feeling. It's super hard to shake it off. So I understanding the rational behind how one cookie isn't going to make me get fat. BUT in the moment I get this anxiety and it's just ""easier"" to binge and then purge than to accept the fact that I just ate 200 calories I shouldn't have eaten.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I've been eating mostly yogurts. I've been drinking frequently. I've been avoiding many solids (for some reason they give me the impression that they'll make me gain weight). My parents arrived yesterday though so when I'm with them they make me eat more normally,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Dear Anna,
Reminding myself that I control my emotions usually works. This weekend I failed at it, when my ex (who broke up with me 2 months ago) started parading around school with his new girlfriend. I decided to be strong but after a while I had to go home. I however have managed to avoid engaging in purging or overeating behaviors. I do restrict a lot, it makes me feel more under control. And I also take laxatives. I suppose I'm still doing things that are bad for me.. they just feel less bad than when I purge. I've been seeing a therapist since last August, and she's been wonderful. These past few months have been difficult though so it's been hard to keep normal eating patterns..",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, how should I log today? I made myself vomit twice last after I logged, so I will log that twice. But, I have been throwing up all day (everyone at my parents' house is sick too), and so I've thrown up at least 3 more times and haven't eaten much. Should I log I restricted? Or...?",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

These feelings are compounded by the fact that I didn't get the project heal scholarship. Now I feel even more strongly that recovery isn't possible for me",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hey Anna. I don't know what I need. I went back to my apartment last night and purged again. I don't know. I'm going to try to get back on track today. I had a good lunch after I worked out and I didn't purge, restrict, or binge. So... That's good. I'm supposed to get drinks tonight with a guy I haven't seen in over a year. I think I'm the same weight, but I'm still nervous he won't think I'm attractive. Anyway, I also think drinking has been making Ed worse so I might not drink tonight. Also, I'm going to try to listen to my body today regarding what and how much to eat. I'm not going to restrict even though I might have a beer. I think a check in with someone after I eat tonight will be necessary. My therapist said I need a higher level of care. I don't know what to do. I think I'm going to try to get into an ED group that meets at least once a week if not 2-3 times. I don't know what other options I have unless I go inpatient.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi, the date went well. I did have two beers, but I also had a cheeseburger (fear food!) for dinner and didn't purge. I only had two meals yesterday, but I didn't feel hungry, so I don't feel like I restricted. Part of that may be because I had beer and that filled me up, but I'm not sure.

,,,,"I'm not sure what is different! yesrerday, when I thought about eating lunch I got really angry and upset. I wanted to cry and not do it... But instead of listening to that, I went out and had lunch with a guy I've been seeing. I didn't have any snacks yesterday because I genuinely didn't feel hungry... I didn't even really feel hungry for dinner, but I made myself eat a normal sized meal anyway. After dinner I stayed productive and busy with chores, drawing, and the body scan meditation on the program. Mother days are similar mentally. Some meals are easier, and I'm less likely to under eat with others and definitely won't binge with others, so the best thing I can do when I'm really struggling with a meal or snack is to have it with someone else and stay with them long enough so I don't purge. At night, staying busy seems to help.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

I don't remember why my anxiety was lower on the 20th, but I do remember I felt very depressed that day... although at least I wasn't very anxious. 
I have been pretty depressed the past two weeks, so I think that's why I relapsed so hard.
I haven't found Phase II that helpful honestly. That may be because I haven't been using it everyday, but also because there are less modules. Of course, that' the point. But it would be nice to have more anyway.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

ED is terrible. 
I had an intake assessment at the Eating Disorder Center of Denver on Wednesday. The woman who did my assessment said she will probably recommend partial hospitalization, but they have to check my insurance and I have to get medically cleared.

I'm going to head in early (around 1pm) so I can meet the psychiatrist, dietician, and my therapist I will see while I'm in the program. Did I say anything else about it? It's four days a week (Monday-Thursday) from 4:45-9pm. I eat dinner there and have two groups.

,,,,"Hey, this is my second week of treatment... The first week was brutal. I had panic attacks during the meals and snacks and during groups, and I had to give up my scale. Yesterday was a good day at treatment yesterday. I had individual therapy where we talked a lot about why I'm frustrated with how my mom doesn't respect my boundaries and about why I feel like I can't trust my instincts anymore. I also made it through dinner at the center without extreme anxiety, and the groups were good because we talked about supporting ourselves and being compassionate for ourselves the way we would for ourselves as kids. We also wrote letters to and from our younger selves, which was interesting because I wrote to twelve year old me to not lose her sense of wonder and to tell her that I love her and see her and get her and that she's and so much more than just smart. And my younger self asked a bunch of questions like if it's going to get better and if I still am passionate about things. Finally, in the last group I processed my own insecurity... Which was hard... But I felt better after everything. I also followed my meal plan the best I've followed it so far yesterday which was a huge accomplishment with how loud ED has been.

,,,,I find when I have a routine and am distracted that I dont even have the desire to binge. When I used to work full time I rarely binged. Usually in the lead up to christmas I go on crazy crash diets so I look good when I see my family and for our yearly family christmas photos. This year I have not done that and am therefore petrified of how big I am going to look in the photos. I haven't been this size for a long time so I'm pretty anxious.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

Food got a little out of control after christmas but the past few days have been going okay. I have been eating more regularly and healthy. I am beginning placement on Monday for two weeks so that will be a pretty hectic time but having that routine and everything again will mean that I am less prone to bingeing. Restricting is my real issue when I am busy and can distract myself from hunger easily.
Unfortunately I haven't had the chance to do some of the coping strategies as I have been around family and haven't had a lot of time to myself over the past few weeks or access to the internet often.
Also, HAPPY NEW YEAR",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,Hey. Yeah going okay thank you. Had a lot more free time this week but have made it through okay. I'm still finding that I'm avoiding things like bread which is a major trigger for me.

,,,,Ive had a little bit of a crazy week and as a result my eating and everything is out of control. My friend came to visit which is always a trigger and got to me more this time as she said I was not eating enough which lead to me bingeing. This then lead to a purge later in the week. Following this I had my nieces birthday party so I was surrounded by food and then today I am home alone and just couldn't control myself. I am scared I am going backwards. Its so hard in the moment to remember breathe or do this or that.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hey yeah I've been crazy busy with study and work. My week is going okay. A lot of ups and downs in relation to how I see myself but overall I think its been more ups which is encouraging.

In relation to food and everything I am a little bit all over the place. Having friends over kind of got in the way of routine/healthy eating and exercise and a lot of junk food and alcohol was consumed. It has left me feeling quite weighed down and anxious but I am trying to get back on track. My boyfriend is exceptionally supportive.

,,,,"I think life would be much less stressful if my self-esteem derived solely from things like having good friends, but I also think that is just a bit unrealistic. If my success in school did not affect my self-esteem, I would not really care at all about school and would not do well in school. Then I would never achieve any major goals, or I potentially would never be able to support myself financially. I am definitely a proponent of trying to keep my expectations and pressure on myself in control in terms of school success so that it does not overpower my happiness or hinder my ability to do well, but I do think a certain amount of pressure on myself from my self-esteem is important. I would be more interested in focusing on ways to balance the amount of pressure I put on myself and finding ways to better appreciate when I succeed than trying to not let my success have as much influence on my self-esteem. Basically I would like to stay positive and gain the confidence that I can succeed, rather than try to lessen the affects of success or lack of success on how I feel about myself.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

As far as patterns in my eating, I think sometimes I tend to eat many snacks instead of meals, and those snacks aren't always the healthiest. I think eating 3 regular meals a day is more beneficial for me, and I seen positive results while eating regularly during winter break! I think my binge behavior has decreased because of less stress with school being over. Because I have less stress, I am able to regulate things like sleep, eating, and exercise more effectively. I have started working out again, which has helped regulate my appetite immensely! I may try the mirror, mirror exercise again, but honestly I had difficulty finding time to fit it in. I also definitely avoided it, but I don't think I avoided it due to anxiety. I'm one of those people who can look in a mirror and be like ""Damn! You look good!"" so honestly it sounds like my kind of activity.

,,,,"Hello Caroline,

Thank you for your very thoughtful message. The past two weeks, I was at the hospital recovering from bradycardia and becoming more nourished. I am transitioning now to a stage of maintaining the progress I made which entails sticking on a meal plan and keeping physical activity to a minimum until I am told that I am able to resume activity. My anxiety has been noticeably elevated during the hospital stay, and I'm hoping it will cool off as I readjust to college life. I will be working with a medical team from here on out to maintain progress I have made over the past couple weeks. 

On another note, what is involved in the next portion of the program? Am I to discuss the strategies we've gone over with you? Cognitive re-framing in particular can be challenging as I search for counter evidence. I find that usually when I am ripping myself apart, I am tired, upset, hurt, or drained in some way. I can work at recognizing these times, and turning to activities that lift my spirits and set me back on track.

Let's keep the conversation going. I'm open to a phone call if you still would like to do that.

Best,

Doni",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I'm indeed back at school now fortunately and have been for a week. I'm checking in with an internist, psychotherapist, psychiatrist, and occupational therapist semi frequently to maintain progress.

Thank you for the message. I really appreciate the recap you sent of our conversation a couple weeks ago. I keep referring to the message to check in to see how I'm doing. I find myself needing to do more physical activity right now than might be advisable, but my mood and general willpower right now are certainly on the upswing. To be honest about the Lantern program, I find the current unit somewhat less productive than the last unit, and I do not quite understand the idea behind trying to come up with specific instances that triggered anxiety and reliving them. If you indeed think this would be beneficial for me, please let me know why, and I will do my best to do periodic check-ins. I hope you are well. 
Sincerely, Doni",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hey Anna. Sorry for not being on here for a while. I had a stressful week back at school. So. I binged really bad last night. I had two pieces of pizza, half gallon bag of totrilla chips, and 1/3 of a box of ice cream. It was bad. Really bad. I was lonely and tired, and just wanted to pig out and watch tv. It just makes me so sad that this is what I want to do with my life when I have free time. I used to like to read, but then when my friend almost died this summer, I no longer find the pleasure in reading any more and I no longer have the friend group that I used to hang out with. So I've turned to binge watching shows. Which then makes me want to eat more. However, Since I started this program, I have limited my binging by a bit, but when I stopped (last week and the week during christmas) I found it super hard to control. So here I am, back again lol",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Sure thing, it's in my calendar! Over the holidays I tried to make some healthier alternatives that still made me feel like I was enjoying a holiday treat. None of the desserts they had were vegan, so instead I made a small marzipan log from scratch. Marzipan is probably my favorite dessert, so I enjoyed it much more than I would have enjoyed the triple chocolate cake my family was eating. I was actually kind of interested in your recommendations on how to implement the forbidden foods lesson. I really only have refined grains when I eat out (which is almost exclusively Japanese food, and I've yet to see brown rice sushi in a restaurant, unfortunately). I actually don't feel like I'm missing out on much, because I really prefer the taste of whole grains anyways! Sugar is the one I'm more reluctant about, knowing that I've had problems with it for quite some time now. It's a long term goal of mine to cut out sugar (added sugar, specifically) except for special occasions, because I really just want to feed my body things that support its health. I've spent the last 3 weeks or so cutting back to one serving of dessert on any given day, and with each successive week I try to cut back the number of days relative to the number of the week (i.e. sugar-free for one day during week 1, two days for week 2, and so on). Does this seem like a good way to enjoy it in moderation for the time being, or would you have any other suggestions?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Moving was pretty intense, but I managed to do it without eating out too much. We're having some technical difficulties with the stove (no burner plates -> burners fall down), but I have gotten around to grocery shopping for specific items rather than using the produce box. Hopefully I'll be able to cook soon! I'm going to try to think of more ideas for lunch, because I think that's the meal I eat out for most and have the least experience cooking for.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hello! One of my more vague New Year's Resolutions is to become more aware of how I'm living by tracking habits, and I think it's helping me to be a lot more conscious of how I do things. When I cook for myself, I usually feel fine afterwards. I might have a snack after dinner (recently its been a sliced apple with a scoop of sugar and salt free peanut butter), but I never really feel hungry. When I eat in the dining halls, I usually feel stuffed and a little lethargic afterwards. Maybe I just have a small stomach? I remember eating in portions similar to what I'm eating now a few years ago, when I got a new cookbook and was cooking for myself for a long while there. I do wonder if growing up in a low income home influenced that at all though, since we'd often make a big meal twice a week and then day it in small portions to stretch it over multiple meals. When I was still bingeing, I don't think I was restricting myself in hardly any way. I'd spend a lot of time thinking about how I needed to change how I was eating, but never put any real effort into it until recently. At my worst, I was averaging two plates, a large bowl, and multiple servings of dessert. And probably running to the student store for late night snacks. It was more a long stretch of bingeing than it was stopping and then starting again.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I have quite a few recipes I've saved from multiple cookbooks and websites, but I think it's a matter of redefining what ""lunch"" means to me. I'm still used to thinking of it like school lunches, and tend to draw a blank when it comes to making it myself (I found myself just making peanut butter on bread lately). Although I have to cook sideways, I managed to get the stove working, so I made coconut curried vegetables over brown rice for dinner last night, and it should be enough to last me a few days.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I've mostly just been eating leftovers for lunch, but I have tried to get more raw produce in around then. I tried peaches and watermelon a few times, and bought a big bag of salad so that way I can save more leftovers for dinner.

,,,,"Hello! I meant that I'd like to start drinking a cup of hot lemon water every morning, and while there's a lot of debate over which benefits are real and which are apart of the fad, there does seem to be a general agreement that it's good for metabolism and digestion. I certainly didn't notice any downsides when I was drinking it every morning a few weeks ago! I also figured I'd clarify the exercise I did tonight, since it didn't seem to flow together quite the way I intended in the summary the program showed me. The general idea was that I'd like to be more mindful when picking things out from the dining hall, maybe by practicing a mindfulness exercise while I'm on my way there or waiting in line.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I've started going to the farmer's market for all my produce, and I actually really enjoy it. There's one every few days in my city so it's easy to get more if I need it, and also to buy in smaller amounts so I don't have to worry about things going bad. I think buying different things from the farmers market based on what's in season is more constructive for me to expand how I cook than the produce box was. Everything is really fresh too, so it tastes amazing! I hadn't noticed that the move wasn't affecting my eating habits much until you pointed it out, but it makes sense to me when I think about it. If I have access to a kitchen and fresh produce, my eating habits only ever get better.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Recently, I decided to start going to the gym again. I know I don't get enough exercise as it is, and I'd like to get back to a more normal weight. I've tried to get myself on a regular exercise schedule several times over the years, but it always seems to fall though after a month or two. I don't want that to stop me from trying again though, and since my university's gym is free and open 16 hours a day, I don't have a good reason not to. I'm trying to go to classes because I never feel into it just running on a treadmill or trying to figure out how to use weights correctly. I'm hoping picking a variety of classes will work - a core class, a cardio class, and a yoga class or two is what I'm aiming to work up to per week. I'm actually about to head off to a yoga class with my favorite instructor right now. I have a lot of reasons for getting back into exercise, but I'm hoping it will help with my body image a little as an added benefit. I've never cared about weight much and still don't, but my shape has been causing me stress lately, so maybe toning up a bit will help.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm enjoying the farmer's market a lot! I went again yesterday. I also like how I'm still able to support the co-op I volunteer at, since they stock dry grains and nuts that are much harder to come by at a farmer's market. I think I tried to push myself to follow exercise plans that were too regimented in the past. Once I tried going to sunrise yoga at 6 am three days a week - needless to say I didn't last long. Or I tried going to the same classes every week. What I'm trying this time is scheduling exercise classes around my work and class schedule, so things change every week. So far it seems to be working, since I haven't missed a class yet!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hello! Finally got both the anxiety check-in and weekly body check-in done. It was an eventful week and I noticed myself turning to things like bread and nuts a lot, and while I'm glad it's not sugar I think I was lacking in produce. As for smart goals, I thought of two. One would be to try for 3 food groups per meal over the course of the next week, more specifically a fruit, vegetable, and either a protein or grain in each meal. The other involves a program I'm involved in at school. I volunteer at a student-run food collective that has weekly produce boxes, and I think I'll pick one up this week and make meals to bring to work over the weekend. Are there any improvements I can make on these?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Things are getting better with food too. I think the meal points system and dining halls that I had access to with the university just made it too easy for me to overeat, and I know better than to trust myself with fast food or late hours now. Having my own kitchen is really helping me redevelop my relationship with food, since I know exactly what goes into it and the effort it takes to make a meal from scratch makes me much less inclined to make something late at night or eat all of my leftovers.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I had quite a few, but I didn't go through everything in one sitting like I used to. I actually felt better after, and I think I'm finally starting to understand the difference between craving something out of habit and craving something because my body needs a nutrient that thing contains. I'm hoping paying more attention to this will help me make better meal planning decisions, because I can tell I'm still lacking in some areas.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Things are getting easier! I'm feeling better about my body already. I've been really happy with how the exercise schedule is working, because it's a lot more flexible than my past attempts. I've made it to almost every class I planned on going to - the one I didn't go to was because the bus didn't come on time for me to make it, so I just walked home for exercise that day instead. Or later this week, my roommate wants to go to the beach on a day I planned to exercise on, so I'm going to switch swimming or surfing out with the class instead.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm also starting to feel like eating only healthy food is helping me understand real cravings more. Last year I was constantly craving sugar and carbs (sugary carbs were even better) in huge amounts, and I never really thought about why. I just knew that I felt even more anxious if I didn't give in, and figured it was attributable to stress. I never felt very good after I ate it either. Last night I really wanted peanut butter, thought about it for a while, and went to the store to get things to make a peanut butter sandwich afterwards.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"The program overall has been really helpful. Sometimes I need the motivation of knowing there's someone waiting on a reply for me to stick with a program, and I think that's why it mostly worked out. I feel a lot more confident in my ability to handle food now, especially since I'm not subject to what's at the dining halls, and since I'm actually using the money I worked for to feed myself. I think I'm in a much better environment now, one where I can actually make the kind of food I want to eat.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hello! As far as carbs are going, I still very much prefer complex carbs. I don't really have sub-preferences within that category, although I am partial to whole wheat. My main concern is that I was eating a larger proportion of carbs in comparison to other food groups. It doesn't seem to be as severe this week, although I did have more sugar than normal. I didn't have multiple servings like I used to, thankfully, but I did have a few days where I had a smoothie or brownie once a day. I'm still in the stages of watching my current sugar consumption to see if this is another sort of week-long phase or something else.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hello! It's something I've dealt with on and off for quite some time now. I remember it happening as early as 6 years ago, but I never had very strict rules about eating when I was growing up, so it's probably been culminating for longer. I think the lack of accountability is why it's continued to come up, which is also why I'm very excited about the program!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Quite a bit has gone on, actually. I moved out of my mother's place about a month before I graduated from high school, and I was bouncing around a few different places until the school year started and I had a dorm to live in permanently. I also spent the summer helping several family members move houses. The busy schedule didn't allow much time for real cooking, and most of those relatives struggle with their weight as it is. Being in my first semester of college with difficult classes has probably contributed to it too, especially since most restaurants are open until 2 a.m. in this area.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I've found it very helpful, actually! I've been keeping track of everything in a fitness journal which also includes a meal planner, and inputting the information here helps me stay on top of my goals better than if I was only putting it in one or the other. I still haven't adjusted to eating at regular intervals, but I think I'll make that a goal to work on for this next week.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Currently, it's finals week, so ""chaotic"" describes every day until Saturday pretty accurately! I think part of the problem is that I haven't been keeping myself on a regular sleep/wake schedule, so sometimes I sleep through breakfast and morning snacks and everything gets thrown off. I'm going to try making the sleep/wake schedule more of a goal to meet by the end of winter break. I also work until fairly late in the evening, which keeps me eating later than I'd like to on weekends. Are there any specific times you'd recommend eating the first and last meals of the day?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you! Finals are over and things will be a little more regular now. I normally work until 7:30 p.m. (although it's currently 9:30 because of extended holiday hours). It takes about another half hour to walk home and get food, and roughly the same amount of time if I eat at a restaurant near my job. I usually don't get around to dinner until 8 at the earliest.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hello! Sorry I haven't gotten back to you in a while; I've been working every day before I go on vacation and was a little busy. I'm very happy with the reduction in bingeing, and am still incredibly surprised how well it worked to start planning and tracking meals. My skin has cleared up considerably, I don't feel nearly as bloated, and I'm not oversleeping quite as much (although it still takes me about a half hour of alarms at 5-minute intervals to make it work, but I'm progressing). I haven't had much of a problem cutting out refined grains, since I never eat them unless they're in sweets anyways. I'm trying to take the sugar part slowly, because I tried going cold turkey on it before and it actually made me feel sick. I've already avoided sugar for two days this week, which was my goal, so I'm free to enjoy in moderation for the holidays! The eating mindfully has worked well, notably because I eat alone during my breaks and there are no distractions. I've actually been looking into self-care routines lately, and I plan on starting them regularly as a part of the new year. A brand of perfume I recently started using is super body-positive, and has a free print out where you cut out cards, put them in a jar, and randomly pick one act of self care every day. I read them over and while I don't think I'll use the jar, I did steal some ideas from my favorite cards. They're simple things, like putting on lotion before bed or soaking in the bath with a cup of tea, but I like them. To answer your other question, I do find it easier to talk to specific people. I have quite a few long distance friends, and it's easier for me to talk to many of them because typing gives me time to think over and refine how I want to express my feelings. I actually didn't know there was a discussion board, so I'll look into that! I think the call on December 26th will work nicely, so I scheduled that into my calendar. The best phone number to reach me at will be (760) 458-8943.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Trying refined grains shouldn't be a problem! I frequent a sushi restaurant that's open late enough for me to eat after work, and to the best of my knowledge they only use white rice. While I'm not exactly thrilled about the lack of brown rice, a roll or two is probably enough to test the exercise in a controlled manner. My manager tends to be very enthusiastic about healthy eating, so she'd probably be a good person to involve, since we already talk about food so often during our breaks.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hello, happy 2015 to you too! Don't worry about the phone call, I'll be happy to save it for another time when the phone lines are up and running again. I've been looking over my food journal, and noticed quite a bit. For starters, I eat much, much more when I'm eating from dining halls than I do elsewhere. It's probably due to the buffet-like nature of it, but when I eat from there, I average a regular sized plate, a bowl, and a small dessert plate. When I eat elsewhere, it's more like a salad plate and occasionally a small bowl. Secondly, the variety of foods I eat seems to be dispersed differently. Eating at school keeps a great variety in dinner, a decent one in lunch, and a poor one in breakfast. Eating outside of that pushes more variety towards the breakfast side, which I'm happy about, because I can only have oatmeal and fruit for so many mornings. Finally, I tend to not eat as well on holidays when other people are cooking. I got to make my own Thanksgiving dinner this year since I stayed on campus, and I was very satisfied with how healthy it turned out. When I visited family for the winter holidays, I was more limited in my options for actual food in comparison to the huge variety of unhealthy drinks and desserts we had. While I still feel I made better choices than I did last year, I'd like to find a way to integrate more healthy options next year. On the bright side, eating a little less healthy on holidays didn't seem to effect non-holidays too much. I don't think I had more than one or two servings of sugar between Christmas Day and New Year's Eve. I'd like to try and save my next dessert for a special occasion like my roommate's birthday later this month, or the Chinese New Year. I'm very excited for the next 10 days! I'll be going back from vacation because I have to work, but the dorms will still be closed, and so will the dining halls. The place I'll be staying at in the meantime has a kitchen, and I'll be cooking for myself entirely while I'm there. It's probably the most independent I've ever been food-wise, and I'm very excited to test run what my natural cooking and eating patterns are like without any outside influences (like holidays) or other sources to be dependent on (like dining halls). The body tracking activity was interesting. The high point seemed to be in the morning, and the low was in the evening. I think it's because when I wake up, my skin tends to be clearer and for whatever reason, my stomach seems much flatter. By the end of the day, my skin's more irritated from hours of exposure to makeup, sun, and toxins in the air, and my stomach becomes a little less flat after filling up on food all day. While a reason or two may be different on any given morning, I noticed that these two factors in particular played a big role in how I viewed myself. I did the mirror mirror exercise in the evening, so my response to that was probably more negative than it could've been at another time of day. That exercise mostly led up to deciding I wanted to focus more on toning up than losing weight. A few days later, however, I happened to have access to a scale for the first time in about 6 months, and weighed myself out of curiosity. I was surprised to learn that I was heavier than I thought, but still felt slimmer than I did about 6 weeks ago when I was still bingeing regularly. Weighing myself sort of lead to a second round of the mirror mirror activity, but I mostly came up blank from that analysis. I actually looked around for the discussion boards, and didn't quite find it. I'm wondering if it might actually just be my computer not bringing up the full menu, because this isn't the first time I haven't been able to locate something, and I'm usually pretty adept at navigating websites. I'll mess around with my screen settings and hope that brings up a menu that's been hiding somewhere! As for the new year, I feel a little stuck. I'm still very surprised and how many major things managed to work their way into 2014. It was a big year for me, so maybe I'm a little reluctant to let it go. Regardless, I'm also still trying to decide what I want to do with 2015. I've never been one for resolutions before, but I figured now's a good a time as any to start making some tangible goals. I have some really vague ideas about things that are mostly health goals, but I don't think they're specific enough to be workable just yet. And finally, the sugar cravings! I think they were at their lowest when I had adequate amounts of natural sugar through fruit, and when I had things with more complex textures (like sunflower seed butter). I'm curious to see how I'll be managing them starting Saturday, when I'm cooking all my own meals!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also, I actually had to set a reminder on the mindfulness tool since I've been a little busy, but I'll be doing that and checking out the discussion boards once I get back from doing laundry!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hello! As a matter of fact, I was kind of reviewing my intentions last night. I needed to pick up a few more groceries after work, and I was fairly hungry. It wasn't easy, but I managed to talk myself out of buying desserts, since I'm not quite sure I can trust myself to buy multiple servings of sugary things yet. Reminding myself how disappointed I'd be if I started bingeing again after coming this far helped a lot. Actually, reminding myself of what I'm trying to accomplish has also encouraged me to start getting support in other areas as well. I'm planning on meeting with an academic adviser so I hopefully don't have a repeat of this last semester, and on the more difficult side I think I'm finally going to make myself a long-overdue appointment with a counselor to deal with some anxiety-related issues. The HBI program is really starting to make me more comfortable with asking for help! Since I've been cooking for myself, I haven't gotten a chance to try out the refined grains. But next week I'll be moving back into my dorms, and my roommates and I will probably go out for dinner to catch up. I'll plan on test-running it then! In regards to emotions, I tend to push them away whenever I feel something I don't like, so it can be difficult to identify what I'm actually feeling. While I'm sure I do this with a lot of emotions, the first that comes to mind is fear. I think I'd like to try incorporating mindfulness more often. I started reading a blog by someone I actually kind of look up to, and she mentioned that she starts every day with a 10-minute mindfulness session straight out of bed. I was thinking I'd like to do that, or at least do it while I'm laying in bed after hitting the snooze button. I really hope that it'll be useful when returning to the dining halls! I'm still not sure what to expect with that, but with any luck I'll be less inclined to overeat since I've been adjusting to smaller portions over the past few weeks.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It really was! My mother was a pretty terrible cook, so she stuck to almost the same thing every night: pasta, frozen vegetables put through the microwave, and bread and butter. She'd buy big family sized bags of everything for the two of us and we'd stretch it until they went on sale again. Twice a month we'd have spam as an indulgence of sorts. It wasn't really until I started earning money and cooking for myself that any variety was introduced, and that was still limited by what I knew how to cook. I wonder if the dining halls affected me so much because it was the first time I could eat as much as I wanted for more than a day or two. Also, I tried both mindfulness exercises last night, and found them very helpful! I have a tendency to get lost in my thoughts on an almost constant basis, so I have no doubt the exercises will be used in the future.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"While the worries are still there, I definitely feel more inclined to get help with them than I did a few weeks ago. The self compassion exercise was helpful, and is something I'd like to continue with on a more daily process. The automatic thoughts exercise was very interesting to me, mostly because I had a really hard time identifying the thoughts in the first place. I understood the concept during the lesson on it, but didn't really identify any of my own until the exercise I did just now. I mainly realized that I had trouble picking the thoughts out because they aren't neatly categorized in my head; it's more like a big bundle where I see all my worries, especially those relating to health, as being interconnected to every other worry. When I worry about something like bingeing, I assume it also effects every other aspect of my life. I'm still processing exactly what to do with this information, but the exercise helped me to better understand what I was thinking in the first place.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hello! I ended up being able to try the food exercises back to back. I had refined grains in a tortilla for dinner two nights ago. I was alone and didn't have much of a problem with it. Last night I tried a new restaurant and decided I'd go for dessert. I looked over the menu all through dinner, and while I nearly got a huge slice of German chocolate cake, I ended up settling for a cookie. I think being in front of people helped a lot. I didn't eat anything after dinner and was happy I managed to control myself after having sugar for the first time in a week. Today I moved back into my dorm and maybe it's just because I associate certain behaviors with certain locations, but I almost immediately wanted to go out for a late night meal or snacks from the student market. The cognitive reframing exercise helped a lot, although the urge to overeat isn't quite gone.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hello! I noticed that I'm most in control of my eating when I cook for myself, hands down. I do pretty well when eating out, and not so well in the dining halls. I already notice that I'm eating more than I have been, and I usually feel a little stuffed afterwards. It's not as bad as it was last semester by any means, but I'm content with the way I've been eating for the past two weeks and would like to keep the patterns similar to that if possible. In regards to the days I've not tracked, it's usually because I'm busy with something else until late at night. The only night I skipped and ate in a way I wasn't entirely happy with was last night, when some friends and I had snacks during movie night. For the most part I don't think there are connections with skipping and eating unhealthy foods, though. Also, concerning the convenience foods, it kind of depends. I don't inherently think all convenience foods are bad, but when I buy them late at night I tend to be tired and more susceptible to buying multiple servings when I'm not thinking clearly. Saying that does make me wonder if the problem isn't even really the foods, but the times I eat them at.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hello! My apologies for the decrease in daily reporting; the first week of school has really kept me busy. I think I was mostly driven by how my eating affected my performance last semester, and seeing all the things I may have to miss out on in spring makes me want to keep things under control so I can avoid a repeat. I noticed some trouble on the holidays and the first few days of school. The grounding exercises stuck the most for me, along with mindfulness practices. This weeks exercises were very helpful when I was doing them on the website, but I have a harder time identifying them outside of that. I think it's something I just need to practice in everyday life, especially knowing that the technique is effective for me.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hello! I ended up making 3 meals over the weekend, and I picked up the produce box so I can make more during this week. Since I'm only cooking for me, it's enough for probably a meal and a snack a day for a week. I did try to notice more what I was eating, and think I might repeat that for another week so I get a more holistic picture of my current eating habits. I think I'll try another goal based off the produce box, like eating one meal a day from it for the next week.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hello, and thank you very much! I was actually very pleased with how my birthday tuned out. I had a small slice of cake at the dining hall for brunch that day, but ate normally aside from that and picked veggie-filled options for dinner that night. I decided to celebrate with elderberry presse with my friends, which is kind of like a herbal tea and lemonade mix. It was much lower in sugar than any dessert I could've picked out and it helped that it was split between multiple people. The poor body image regarding my stomach seemed to blow over pretty fast, thankfully. I dropped quite a few jean sizes since I stopped consuming so much sugar, which has been good motivation to keep eating healthy. I did have a few days where I ate more carbs than I would have liked to, but it was to a lesser extent than the week before, and seemed to be a result of not sticking to my sleep schedule. Now that my classes are definite for the rest of the semester, I feel I have a more stable schedule again, and am less inclined to stay up until odd hours and start snacking. The week has mostly been one of getting back on track after a sudden bump in the road, but I think it's not bad that I had the opportunity to gauge how well I'm able to handle my eating during unplanned events",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hello! Sorry for the short disappearance, the week leading up to spring break gets pretty busy. The carb consumption I mentioned last time seems to have balanced out, since I've been eating more in the way of produce instead of tons of bread. I've been working on my sugar habits more lately. I feel more confident in my ability to have it in moderation since I spent time trying to wean myself off multiple servings. There were two occasions when I had seconds, but it never went beyond that and I felt pretty satisfied with the first serving. I've been finding ways to make desserts a little more nutritious, like making beet brownies from scratch or getting sticky coconut rice with mango from the Thai restaurant near me. I still feel like dessert doesn't have to be an every day occasion, but I'm more able to enjoy it when I want it now.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you! I've been working more on finding healthier desert alternatives this week - a local bakery makes whole grain, sugar free cookies and the food collective I volunteer at sells some amazing raw chocolate that's free of sugary additives, so I've been snacking on those and lots fruit. Mangoes are finally coming into season which makes me very excited, since they're one of my favorite fruits. I found the gratitude exercises very enlightening and am starting to consider keeping a gratitude journal as a regular practice.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Jacqui,
I?m back! 
Things been busy and I just didn?t have the mental power or time for hbi. I?m glad to get back on it though. 
I went back through the msges and I will go through them:
You asked ?What do you plan to do to take care of yourself through all of those stressors? Any tools you've learned through this program that might help??
I?ve been trying Yoga so far and just avoid situations that are tricky for me. Taking deep breaths and trying to give myself time. During this time I think I did OK. I had some close calls and ?almost? bingeing. But nothing close to what used to happen so I?m really glad about that :) 
So far I?m thinking:
1. Organized schedule for eating
2. Not getting too hungry
3. Don?t buy foods like chocolates and etc.
4. Allow to enjoy food/desert once in a while (first scheduled and then 
5. Working out regularly is really helping me. I just have to push myself for that.
6. In the situations I feel I?m sliding, try breathing exercises, Yoga and socializing.
I still have some weight I want to lose, so it?ll still be challenging to keep the balance yet. 
I still think of food as sth that can calm me down, so the mentality of food as a reward and sth to calm me down is still there.
We can absolutely schedule a phone call. What is a good time for you? I prefer next week if that works. 
I haven?t really looked into the discussion board but I?ll keep you updated on that.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"the meal planner is good, but I've been using ""My Fitness Pal"" App for a while before starting this program. So I'm used to planning and keeping track. I've found that I give up on tracking as soon as I feel I'm not doing ""good"" and I don't do ""well"" when I'm stressed (or bored.)",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Jacqui, Thanks for the feed back! I tried to answer all the question in the following:
What are the main differences you have noticed between the eating tracking and meal planning tools in this program versus My Fitness Pal?
With My Fitness Pal, I don?t put in the hours I eat but it?s easier to log in and see what I?m supposed to it or have eaten in the day. I can look at the nutrition and maybe reflect back at the end of the week on my eating. 
When meals didn?t go as you planned, what sorts of things got in the way?
Usually being tired, unmotivated or anything that brings me down emotionally. The fact that I don?t think I?m fit as of right now, makes it harder to not feel down and follow my plans. 
And about the discussion board, no I didn?t know about that. I have a hard time logging in and when I try to reset my password it says that it doesn?t find my email Do you know who I can contact regarding technical issues as such?
Thanks",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

A good work out makes me feel better about my body for sure. And of course in the times that I get closer to the body image I have, I?m very happy. 
Next msg I?ll reply to your feedback for section.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"As you were keeping track of your eating patterns was there anything in particular that you noticed?
I?ve noticed this before but I usually tend to crash after a 5 day of healthy eating. And I end up eating thing that I don?t even like which is where my binging happens.
Did you have an opportunity to practice some of the new strategies you identified, like trying not to stay alone and eating with other people? How helpful were they?
Depends on who I?m around with and how comfortable I am. But in general staying alone is not a good idea for me! But again I still can?t manage to not be alone all the time so I still would like to have a better solution than ignoring the situation. I certainly agree that staying alone and being around unhealthy food are just bad environment for me.
And for the breathing, I?m trying to do it in the morning and afternoon, I?ve tried this before but the habit never really stuck. Hopefully this time. 
Routine or a mix-up?
Have you noticed that integrating self-care impacts your mood, your eating habits, or reduces your vulnerability to bingeing?
It certainly does. Problem is in the situation, I talk myself into binging by saying ?I deserve it? or sth like that. Knowing this I try to be smart about it and it helps for the first lets say 3 times, but I give up the forth time!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I try to track my eating, right now I wanna loose weight so I try to be on a lower calorie side. But when I do work out I generally just go with eat whenever hungry and drink water (but that's the ideal routine I would like to have!) And in general a healthy day is : breakfast: protein and some carb (for ex. potatoes and eggs), 2-3 snacks of fruits and almonds, lunch usually carb and protein as well (rice and lentils for example) and dinner vegetables mainly with maybe a portion of protein either eggs or tofu. I have plenty tea and a cup of coffee usually as well. Things that I try to avoid are Sodas, chocolates or anything sugary or treats like that, unhealthy snacks, excessive amount of carb (like bread) or nuts.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey Jacqui, thanks! I hope you enjoyed your weekend as well :) My school starts tmrw so I spent my time mainly getting things ready and have relaxing time with my sister. 
And I'm happy to answer any questions so please ask!
I actually feel really good physically, and also mentally. but things I end up craving at the end of the week are crunchy things like nuts and pretzels and chips! I'm usually not hungry but not stuffed either. I do agree that the varity might not be as much but I don't think I get mentally bored with it, because I'm eating all the stuff I really like! so I don't feel deprived",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think these behaviors happen when I'm concerned (which is most the times) so just to be clear, the ideal pattern that I'm not deprived and I fell satisfied happens not that often at all. last time was about over three months ago that I was working our regularly and I felt I'm in control. No I haven't done the starving thing any more, and I still tend to choose ""veggies"" Vs. Bread and cheese for dinner but I just feel that's a healthier choice. So I'm being careful with my choices and usually the food that I really want is not healthy. so it's a little hard to find the balance of ""Eating what I really want"" Vs. having some self control and eating healthier options. I do allow myself to cheat once in a while but still don't feel exactly guilt-less about it. and by cheating I don't mean binging, I mean ordering pasta Vs. Salad/Soup or a healthier option in restaurant or having a desert.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

As far as the respond to your feedback:
I only did the Mirror, Mirror Exercise once.
It made me feel more cautious and bad about my body. Overall it wasn?t a pleasant exercise but I can definitely see that it can be helpful and will try it more often. I hope to be able to do the relaxing exercises more often as well. 
I don?t really know what has changed for my bingeing just yet, but bingeing once or twice a week is my average. 
I?m still working issues out with the technical team. 
Have a great weekend",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Jacqui, 
Hope you had a great weekend! Thanks for the feedback and encouragement. I appreciate it :) 
I think introduicing the forbidden foods to my routin can help a lot. I had a much easier time intriducing bread which I still consider a ratehr healthy choice to my routine. But the Pizza and Ice cream was challenging. The way I ended up doing it by trying to commpensate for eating the Pizza and balancing it out by my other meals and also having two pieces. I didn't feel bad about it afterwards because it was planned but still wasn't exactly comfortable either. 
And eating in public with company can keep it controlled however after having that, I didn't feel that I treated myself to anything. I rather if I'm having Pizza once a week have it at house where I can relax with family and really enjoy it. The fact that I don't enjoy the food as much with company also prevents me from eating more than I should. 
I still need to work on grounding, I only tried it once and it was when I was ratehr relaxed.

I get in a bad mood, don't wanna get out, start arguing with my sister who I live with. This happened two weeks ago as well. So I know it's more likely to happen in the weekend, but I end up feeling, ""this is my freedom, I can let go now"" and binge eat and feel bad about it later. Honestly I know probably my life wouldn't be so different even if I had the body I want. Cause probably then I would obsess about keeping it that way, or making a little better one way or another. But I feel the body I have now is live 10 lbs more than my normal weight and that makes me cautious and unhappy. And I understand that this shouldn't be as big of a deal as I'm making it to be, but I frankly woke up this morning very upset just because of it.

Maybe talking to someone will help, and I will definitely take that into account this week. I feel like even though my progress has been slow, I can see a change in my perception.

I have felt that at some points, I have had the want to binge on sweets, but since we do not keep any in the house, it makes it easier to overcome (and of course the techniques I have learned really help!).

I wasn't stressing out, but I definitely was expressing concern for this week and how I felt like I had a lot to accomplish for school, but didn't feel like I had the time. After talking to her I walk into my apartment and one of my suite mates bought a lot of pizza for some collaboration event that she had. It honestly felt like once I ended the call and vented about what I was concerned about to my mom and then walked through the front door, I snapped or something shifted in my mood/mindset. I just wanted to eat the pizza and didn't care that I knew I would regret it later. I wasn't significantly hungry since I've been trying to snack more and not go hungry throughout the day, but it seemed like the pizza was what would make me feel better and be less anxious or worrisome about the upcoming week. I noticed this same sort of shift this past weekend as well. I felt like there was so much going on in my life, but I had so little time to do it. It goes back to me not feeling in control....I hope this helps! I really appreciate all that you have done!

,,,,"Hi Elise! The Dear Body exercise was something that I have never done before and I actually really liked it. It did feel funny, but I thought it was great for me to see how I really feel and to see my thought process, both on how I view my body and how I think about myself. I'm excited that I get to participate in this program because I think it can really offer some great insight and advice into helping me have a more positive mindset about my body and myself. I guess in terms of function, I'm happy that my stomach can enjoy and digest the food that I eat and that I'm lucky to have the feeling of being full, but other than that I can't think of anything else.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks Elise! I am happy that I am aware of what triggered this incident, if it weren't for you checking in on me and asking those hard hitting questions I might not have made the connection so soon, so I thank you!! Looking back, I do feel that venting/talking things out with people such as my mom is helpful for me. It allows me to see the big picture and she also is such a great supporter to me, BUT I think that starting now, after I have those venting/stressful talks I need to do something that will counteract those feelings that have arisen. So maybe after I vented and stressed out to my mom, I should let it all out, but then designate some time to unwind and destress. We could focus on talking about more positive things or anything that will calm me down and not feel like I am out of control. Take a couple of deep breaths and avoid talking about or thinking about the negative things...I hope I answered all your questions!

,,,,"Hi Elise! I?ve been trying to implement Me Time before going to bed. At this point I have already done my night regime of having a clean body, a clean face, with freshly brushed teeth. What I like about this time is that I feel like I?m washing away the day, good and bad, with some yummy scented body washes, shampoo, conditioners, or whatever. Also I have a particular regime when washing my face, which for some reason soothes me. I think it has to do with the idea that I?m taking care of myself and it just feels good to moisturize and replenish my skin. After my hygiene routine I feel relaxed and ready to unwind. At this point I like to either read, watch a tv show, listen to music, or really anything that doesn?t have to do with school, softball, or whatever else goes on in my life...When I say strong, what I was trying to implicate was that I felt like I was in control, like I only ate when I actually was feeling hungry and that I wasn?t eating due to emotional triggers. Although I will admit that at times I do fall in that category of ""if I'm gonna blow it, I'm going to eat as much as I want and get back on track tomorrow?, BUT I?m pretty positive that I haven?t felt or thought like that since starting the program?¦..I never realized how feeling fat isn?t actually a feeling! That day I felt gross, both physically and mentally, and stuffed. I think maybe me using the word fat, is me really saying that people who are thinner than me are more in control of what they eat and they wouldn?t eat as much as I just did. Hope that helps!

,,,,"Also, I've been meaning to ask you what exactly is considered a meal? Like how much food are we talking about?? Sometimes my days are so hectic, especially during days when I have softball games that we don't have time to eat meals but eat various snacks in between games.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"No problem! Thanks for letting them know!....Not potentially annoying at all!! Honestly I feel like the beginning of this school year my ""meals"" and meal times are all mixed up and varies day by day. Because of softball I have to either wake up at 5:30 or 6:30 in the morning for weights/conditioning or practice. Being that it is so early, I'm not hungry to eat a full meal (which for breakfast I like to eat oatmeal, fruit, eggs, or granola and milk and some coffee), but I don't want to workout or practice on an empty stomach so I always eat a banana. After that practice I then eat what I consider breakfast, but depending on the day, my breakfast is either at 7 AM or 10:30 AM. So I feel like my snack times and breakfast times are reversed, if that makes sense. Also, I'll admit that I mentally keep track of what I eat, because I have noticed that since I wake up so early, my days are longer, and because of that I feel like I get hungry more often, which makes me worried that I'll gain weight and in a sense guilty. AND now that I'm actually writing out what I have been thinking, I'm starting to think that me thinking this is not such a good thing and I don't really know what sort of meal plan would work for me. Sooooo to answer your question, a meal to me is something that is healthy and that I enjoy eating and makes me full, but the amount of food varies depending on the time of day....I hope this helps and I apologize for the super long response!!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

But the other hour of working out I did on Monday was p90x which I started the Monday before. I only do this every other day. So I am hoping it becomes kind of a regular thing?

I feel much more ready to tackle my eating habits again since I have a little break before my next round of tests. Hopefully that stress doesn't send me into a spiral of unhealthy eating again.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I would love to schedule a phone call, I'll look through my calendar tonight while I complete the session and hopefully we can find a time to connect! Thanks!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi! Yes! My stress definitely affects my eating habits. I am all about the all or nothing! Sadly, that completely describes me. Sometimes I totally self sabotage, and it's practically on purpose. If I am craving a cupcake, for example, I will go to the kitchen and before eating the cupcake I will go find something else unhealthy to eat, like a slice of pizza. Then, once I've decided my eating for the day is ruined because of the pizza I ate, I will totally find eating a cupcake justified! It's a completely terrible cycle. In my head of course I know how justifying one bad food with another doesn't really help me out at all, but my self discipline is so unreliable. It's a huge struggle of mine!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

Then maybe sometimes if I feel like switching it up I can run with him. He always invites me but I never go, maybe I finally will take him up on it! I just really quickly looked at that link and the site looks really great! I will try to take a look closer tomorrow and I will let you know how I plan to use it!

Tomorrow I have a pretty empty evening so if I have extra time I might try to do something tomorrow too. I found a couple yoga videos that look good! I still haven't been able to take a good look at the site you gave me, but I have been writing down what I've eaten and I'm trying to really pay attention to when I get hungry.

,,,,"Hey Jenna,
I'm so sorry I haven't been keeping up with the program recently. I had a busy week at school with two tests and then last week I was on Spring Break. No excuse at all - in fact I had more free time since I didn't have class. I think I just got in a vacation mindset (more of that all or nothing mentality that I continually struggle with) and I didn't take time to log in. I definitely struggled while on Spring Break. I kind of threw healthy eating and exercise out the window and ate what I wanted and had some drinks with friends several nights. Other than last week, I had been keeping a solid food journal. I notice that I eat a kind of large breakfast right when I wake up (I wake up hungry at about 7!) and then I don't find time to eat again until after I'm home from class which is not until 2:30. Then I feel like I'm starving. I think this week I want to try eating more small meals throughout the day instead of doing the three big meals. What do you think of that strategy? I tried it today and I did pretty good, I ate a smaller breakfast and brought a granola bar to school so when I got home I didn't feel quite so hungry which I think let me make smarter decisions. I really hope since I am back at school I will be more diligent about logging in. I really apologize for being gone and I value the time you put in, so it's only fair that I put in time as well!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I sent them an email! Thanks for that info! I will try to think about what affects my body image. I know I compare myself a lot to other people, especially while I'm at school. I'm constantly surrounded by other students who are in a similar situation as me: going to school, doing extra curricular activities, having similar concerns like grades and finding jobs or internships. I think my thought process is: ""if this girl walking by me is doing the same sort of stuff I am, how come she manages to be so fit and I am struggling?"" I think my age makes me harder on myself too. I am 25 going to college so I expect to be able to do everything that an 18 or 19 year old going to college can do. I should be more responsible, so actually I should be able to do things better! But I disappoint myself when I think I'm failing at things other people are winning at. I wish I wasn't so focused on looks!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey, I feel like last weekend I did really good compared to others! I'm not sure if tracking my feelings was what did it or not. I want to try again this weekend and see if I can still do well.

,,,,"Hi! I really like your response to me comparing myself to others! I really do that automatically, so if I can get in the habit of focusing more on my own journey rather than theirs that would be really helpful. I'll try to work on that! Ok, my eating habits haven't been good the last few days. My mom came to visit for Easter and I overate. I really really have trouble with indulging. I'm not sure why I can't get myself to fully commit to eating well more regularly. I feel like I do fine during the week but every weekend I go in vacation mode. And Easter made it much worse. My mom brought a ton of delicious yet unhealthy food! (think ice cream with toppings, mashed potatoes and gravy, pasta salad, etc.) And then left it all here so I'm tempted! I should probably get rid of it. I wish I had the self control to use the leftovers in moderation as small snacks, but I have already eaten two bowls of ice cream today! Oh no!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey Jenna, yes those binges happened over the weekend. I ate until I felt sick on Saturday and then did it again Sunday(Easter). Any time I eat badly it's pretty consistently on the weekends. I think during the week school and homework keeps me busy so I'm not getting bored and eating, or eating aimlessly while in front of the tv. I have definitely been feeling more in control since I started the program! I have also noticed that when I stay on top of the program, like checking in frequently and doing the Daily Sessions, I am also eating well and being active. I really think the accountability is helpful!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey Jenna! I can definitely start writing about how I feel before I eat on the weekend. I am not sure of why I eat bad on the weekends. My first thought was that I eat bad because I feel I deserve it after eating so well for 5 days straight. Maybe that's part of it, but during the week I never really feel that deprived. I don't go hungry all the time, I'm not constantly craving things. I actually feel really great during the week when I'm eating better and being more active. During the weekends it feels great while I'm eating, but I end up feeling guilty afterwards which kind of casts a shadow over all of the progress I feel I'm trying to make. So I am not sure why I choose to eat so bad on the weekends. The only other cause I can come up with is just that I've had 25 years of bad eating habits, and I do get sort of exhausted trying to get rid of them!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey! I had a rough beginning to the week. I am still not doing as well as I was before Easter. I have had friends over and have been encouraging them to eat the food my mom left behind! Haha. I've given away almost all of the candy and served three bowls of ice cream for my friends(I had a bowl too - but hey at least that's three bowls I'm not eating right?). I never got to eat my first forbidden food. I know I scheduled it but I don't remember when...and then today I scheduled the next one on the list. So maybe I will try to do my first forbidden food this week before my second forbidden food. I My favorite techniques are probably the 4-7-8 breathing (very relaxing!) and the meal planner, which I want to try to use more. I also love all the advice on the first page of the Prevention technique. Sometimes I just go look at that page and remind myself to be mindful and drink water and make a plan etc. It's got good tips!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey! Yeah I did track my emotions! Yesterday I woke up feeling really empowered. I ate a really good breakfast and felt really fulfilled and proud. I went on a 4.5 mile walk with some girlfriends from school, and then ate with my brother after that. I was feeling pretty anxious to eat since I was really hungry after the walk and we decided to go to a fast food restaurant. I looked at the menu ahead of time though and made the decision of what to order before we got to the restaurant so I wasn't trying to make decisions there. I ordered and I did pretty good! I felt full after but not stuffed, and didn't order a shake which is something I get every time I go to that restaurant (It's called Culver's if you know it). As for dinner, I didn't even feel like I was going to attempt to eat well for some reason. I was kind of hungry but not starving, and when I went to the fridge I kind of felt like i didn't care if I ate good or not. So my emotions were kind of nonchalant. I ended up eating a bunch of Brussels sprouts of all things. Not the most balanced meal, but I felt satisfied when I was done and didn't eat anything else. Today I was kind of stressed about my weekend coming to an end, but I ate well today to! I even said no to my brother offering ice cream!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I have been working out longer and more frequently.so far I've been able to sustain it, but I'm still nervous that if I overdo it too much I'll just stop altogether. It hasn't been affecting my eating even though I really thought it would. So I guess that's good?",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"For the pizza, I ate with my brother and he helped encourage me to not overdo it. Also, I want super hungry either when we decided to eat it, I had a bowl if oatmeal an hour before so I think that helped that I wasn't super hungry. I also tried to eat slowly so I could give body time to feel full.

Because I am tall, I know my body is (and should be) bigger than my short roommates, but I get trapped in a negative way of thinking. When I am around my teammates, I feel more able to celebrate what my body is capable of doing instead of just focusing on what it looks like.

I was feeling stressed about some school-related work that was bothering me from the morning and although I enjoyed my 9-hour day, it was still at the back of my mind.

,,,,Yes it is true. The thinness came at a huge cost. The body-shaming was everywhere. But this also baffles me: how some do not have to put up with this cost to be thin.

I owe you many thanks for your support. Your encouragement has meant a lot to me. I'm glad I was able to pull myself mentally together.

,,,,"Hi Elise! 
I'm sorry for not keeping up with the program. I've gotten much more comfortable about eating and I still have yet to schedule an appointment with Brian. His schedule is a bit funny and doesn't match mine this quarter, but I'll see if I can find out the dates of my midterms and make my plans accordingly. 
I've also realized that a great way to keep my destructive self-esteem at bay was to actually find some interesting to study - physics. Working on physics requires all my attention, and that really helps me do something productive. Afterwards I usually set a worry time and get all my feelings out. 
As for my pre-rhythmic self, it's kind of hard to remember. My coaches' actions made me really negative and always compare myself to others. It was more of a change in environment. Previously I was surrounded by kids who were always bigger and taller than me. When I came to rhythmic, I increasingly saw more and more waifs. Now in college I am in the middle - I'm good but never good enough. It sounds very strange but I feel that I gauge myself based on surroundings.

If I do make an effort to eat at regular times will this subside? That's another thing I forgot to mention - I gain and lose very quickly! 
I can only hope that when these feelings leave can I end this terrible habit of being terribly jealous of others. It's gotten me into a lot of trouble in my relationship with my sister (who is naturally very skinny!!) especially, and of course the people who think I am hostile. 
I can give your suggestion a go for tomorrow. Maybe I'll start with one item for my three snacks, like breakfast. 
Thanks again for your kind message!! It's been great working with you! 
Take care!

,,,,"Hi Elise! 

Really sorry about being not on top of things and diligently logging in! We are in dead week, the week before finals. School is going better now that I have some tools forcing myself to take my mind off thinking about food, but body image and mood haven't improved much. I feel like that even though I'm not thinking about food as much as anymore, the diet Brian made me go on (with a very heavy increase in carbs) did cause some weight gain. I did it for a week and my clothes feel much tighter for some reason. The portions were also much bigger than what I'm used to, since he told me to eat half a plate of grains, and a third of veggies, a protein, a glass of milk, and a cup of fruit. I think this is too much. How do you think? 

Thanks again for your encouragement. I hope I am getting better! Once I'm on spring break I will have time to regroup. 

Take care, 
Cindy",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Elise! 
I'll try Brian's suggestion with carbs when I'm on spring break, so that my family can know what's going on with the counseling I'm receiving. The new diet plan is strange, and I know from previous experience that my body likes to store carbs. All I want is to maybe not dip all the way down to 105 pounds but to maintain my weight and eventually balance it out to around 115 pounds, which is exactly in the middle of my current weight and my previous weight. It's just been a real struggle to see my weight change so fast, and even faster with a new diet plan that shows how much my metabolism is wrecked. The moment I eat more than what I'm used to, or when I try too break my cycle of binge-restrictive eating, I start noticing weight changes. 

My family is supportive, but I admittedly feel I am really spoiled and still a very big crybaby around them. I want to be independent. I'm almost 19 years old and I feel I should be in more control of my life and be able to battle these feelings better independently. This and the fact that I feel like my family doesn't quite understand me at times are causing me to shy away from getting their help. That's also the same case with friends. How can I communicate more effectively to make sure they are understanding how much of a struggle it actually is for me? 

I hope I can at least be in some control of my feelings. The last conversation I had with my parents about this they told me it was absolutely wrong for me to worry about weight at a time like this (dead week, finals), and that ""girls need to have more meat on their bones to look good"". I feel like I have already too much on me, and that advice just doesn't help. They're just glossing over the real cause and not doing anything to actively combat these recurring thoughts. Any suggestions? What do you think? 

Thanks again so much for your help! At least I am enjoying the feeling of waking up a little earlier and sleeping earlier to get a bite of breakfast in. 

Talk to you soon!

,,,,"Hi Elise! 
I'm glad these check-ins can be an occasional welcoming study break. I can finally release some of the feelings I've been harboring lately. Going along with my additional comments I've added with the weekly body check-in, it's been extremely difficult for me to get in touch with people; instead, I mask everything. I just have to hold out for a few more days until the end of finals, so I've been putting on my best make-up smile and shutting these thoughts as best as I could, to prevent any distraction from my studies. This quarter was better than the last quarter in terms of studies, especially when I started taking physics. However, to prevent a repeat of least quarter's academic disaster, I forcing myself to stay put and hold out until the very last exam, which is on Tuesday. After this quarter ends, I will have more time to hopefully heal myself. I'll show the diet plan that Brian made for me to my parents, and use some of these techniques to inform my parents how I'm being treated. I'll follow Brian's new experiment, and see how it goes. It's a strange experiment to me. Losing weight is a bad thing. He wants to see how well my weight changes after two weeks on a 1200 calorie diet. If I lose weight, then he's bumping the calories up! I hope whatever he does it will get me to know the current state of my metabolism. 
Thanks again for your wonderful encouragement! It really means the world to me at this point. 
Take care!

,,,,"Hi Elise! 
MY family has tried giving me support but their support is also unfounded in my opinion. My mom is great at saying that losing weight through severe reduction is unhealthy, but she does not understand that I do not want to fit into a curvy body type. I'm not curvy at all - I am of a very even build. I do not have a distinguishable waist and hips, my thighs are bulky throughout (not just my upper thighs), and I cannot wear a size A bra. I am not naturally thin nor curvy, and it seems to be that I'm being swung from being matched to being one form or the other. Unfortunately for me it always seems easier to look better by being thinner. Being curvy just doesn't matter to me so much. I'm not bothered by what the media says about being curvy. I am however bothered by this evenness. 
As for carbs it was mainly the result of many years of rhythmic gymnastics. It was always a forbidden food, and anyone caught sneaking sweets or even possessing snacks that are carbs (granola bars and the like) is in for big trouble. When I was very young if I took a few potatoes for breakfast the coaches will take away my plate and throw everything in the trash. 
I don't know if I mentioned to you yet but the original plan Brian had made for me was too much. I was being stressed out by meeting the requirements and I did temporarily gain a few more pounds - I have no idea why. Now he is trying to do an experiment. My diet would be 1,200 calories but it incorporates more carbs than I usually take in. The reason for doing this experiment is to determine what my metabolism's current state is. If I'm losing weight on a 1,200 calorie diet, I'm in trouble (my metabolism is wrecked from gymnastics). Brian's next steps, either cutting more calories or increasing calories, will depend on the results. 
Thanks so much for your help and keep in touch! 
Cindy",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Elise! 
As much as I hate to admit it, it is true that the rhythmic gymnastics mentality is still very much alive. Before gymnastics I was thin but unfit, but I didn't pay attention to my body image at all! I suffered a lot from slow growth and was always in the 3rd percentile. But it all changed when I started rhythmic. Suddenly I was told to pay attention to my body image, because I constantly need to lose weight. It's disheartening because the term ""body image"" didn't even exist in my life before rhythmic - it was suddenly introduced with such a negative association. How can I be happy with what I have? 
On the nutrition side I am happy with Brian's experiment so far - I feel more balanced in terms of energy. He said that these tests will help stabilize metabolism in the end, so I felt better about following his exact plan and also about eating four servings of carbs a day. The only thing I need to make sure to eat sparingly is calorie-dense foods in order for the experiment to work. Otherwise, I'm getting a good breakfast from oats and milk, noodle soup for lunch, and a sandwich with salad for dinner. My everyday snack is usually fruit, sometimes yogurt. With your help and this program's advice, I'm glad that my meals are finally becoming more regular, as they have been a long time ago. 
Thank you so much for your great help! Even though my body image still bothers me very much, some of the coping techniques really helped me keep my focus on the tasks at hand. I've been doing so much better academically - now my GPA is very healthy!

,,,,Hi Anna. I am so sorry. I had surgery on my knee and was hoping yo get back to the program over the next couple of days but my recovery has been taking a lot longer than I expected. Do you think I can postpone the program until when I'm a bit further along with recovery?,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna,

I am sorry for falling out of communication for so long. My recovery from my knee surgery has been atypical and I have been stuck in an infirmary for most of the last three weeks. However, I am out now and ready to re-engage with the program. Thank you for your support and understanding along the way.

,,,,"Hi Anna. I just went through my program for today and it made me wonder whether I should take a break from Lantern for a little longer. I realized that my eating and exercising habits are very atypical at the moment anyway as I recover from surgery. My pain control medications have taken away my appetite, I am limited in my eating options because I am unable to cook myself food, and I can't exercise other than a little physical therapy because my knee is still very sore. Do you think it would be a good idea to wait for a while until I am back to a more typical routine before progressing further through the program?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, I am starting to get back into life as usual after my surgery and feel that the program will be very helpful again now. I will try to make sure I get back on track with it over the next week.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,I found the self-cimpassion topic today really interesting as that is something I struggle with.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Do you have any other ideas of how I can manage my anxiety? I think a lot of my eating trouble stems from feeling anxious and out of control in other areas of my life, and eating has become a way of gaining control. I feel like I have to eat a certain amount of something to somehow make things right. I know it sounds irrational when I say it aloud! Thanks so much for all of your help!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Ellen! I've been trying the regular eating strategy and it is really working well. Although it seems kind of counter-intuitive, eating more often is making me think about food less. I've also been trying the breathing technique. I'm finding the second one (counting breaths) better than 4-7-8.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Thank you so much for your response the other day. It is really nice to know there is someone out there with support and ideas. The regular eating thing is still working quite well. I had a bad day today though because I felt really tired and did not have the energy to exercise but then told myself off about it for the rest of the day and struggled not to restrict my food.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,You asked what kind of thoughts run through my head when I am feeling anxious. I?d say it is a stream of jumbled up worries. All of the things that I feel like I haven?t done ?right? or times when I haven?t lived up to my own expectations of myself. I often feel the need to do things a certain number of times to ?fix it?.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,So I think that figuring out better ways to both manage the anxiety in the first place (like the breathing technique I learned here) and also finding other strategies to break the loop (like maybe your idea of talking back to the thoughts) will really help.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It seems to be a battle on two fronts! I?ll try to find some ways of cognitive reframing over the next day or so. I think it will be a challenge, but I am up for it! 
Thanks again for all of your help :)",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I feel like I need to count in a lot of areas of my life, but particularly with eating. I've noticed it happens when I feel bad about what I have eaten or want to eat. Because I can never 'fix' it by changing the past, I can only eat more, and that often leads to eating way too much.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It sounds bizzare when I try to explain it! I was once informally diagnosed with OCD and that seems to match my experience quite well in many ways. I know that the counting is a maladaptive strategy but the problem is that it often works and feels like the easiest way to get through the anxiety. However, it makes me feel even more out of control afterwards and then I feel guilty that I was not able to cope in a better way.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Ellen,

I?m sorry I haven?t replied in quite a while. I ended up with a really hectic week of school work so only had the time to quickly check in for the sessions. I think the reason why I binged more often in the last week was because I felt out-of-control with my school work, and eating felt like a way to gain control over my life. I guess that?s why it happened despite the fact that I actually felt quite in-control of my eating itself.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It seems like my two go to strategies to gain control over things are to restrict what I eat or to count (or both!). But neither of these makes me feel any better in the long run. In fact, they make me feel worse. I think I need to find other channels through which to gain that sense of control back. One thing that I tried yesterday was to sit down and go over my to do list instead of eating. Do you think that will work? Or do you have any other ideas?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"PS. I loved the quote today that ""flexibility is the highest form of control"". I never looked at things hat way before. I've often felt that sticking to my 'rules' shows the greatest strength, but I guess that it is actually harder to exist somewhere 'in the middle' and be flexible, sometimes allowing myself to eat things and sometimes not.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also, I wanted you to know that the regular eating is still working really well. I think it is contributing hugely to me feeling more in control of my eating itself, aside from when I eat due to stress and external factors. I've realized that regular eating, and allowing myself to eat a bit of those 'forbidden foods' (which I've conveniently read about in Lantern today) actually decreases the amount that I eat overall :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,PPS. I am loving the Lantern program now that I am getting back into it properly and am finding it really valuable. I know that I have limited time left to do it though. Is there any way that I could extend my program to complete more units? Even if I have to pay extra?,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I would really love to keep working with you in particular because I am finding your support super helpful.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"That is such good news that I will have the chance to go further through the program. Thanks so much for talking to them about extending it for me. I really appreciate the opportunity as I am finding it really useful. Knowing that the learning material is there, and that you are there, to regularly check in with is really giving me the confidence to make some changes and figure out ways to be healthier and happier :) THANK YOU.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,I also worry that if I am easier in myself I won't drive myself to be my best me.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It is so good to add more and more tools to my tool box as I feel like I have a range of things that I can try at different times now. I think it is all of these things put together that are contributing to me restricting my food and bingeing less. It?s giving me heaps more confidence. I really hope I can keep it up though. I am nervous that I might let things slide and go back to struggling again, particularly when things get more stressful. It is hard to believe that I can actually stay on top of this. Do you think it is really possible?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I think I'll need to disentangle these things in my mind.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Ellen. I?m sorry I haven?t replied for a while. I?ve had a really hectic week with school work and only just managed to fit in the sessions. That is exciting news that you will be having a baby! I?ll be sorry to lose you as my coach though. You have been wonderful. Thank you for letting me know. I found the forbidden foods this week pretty challenging, but also empowering when I realized that it is okay to eat a little bit of them as they can?t make me instantly fat! The scariest was fries, as I almost never let myself eat them as I know how unhealthy they are.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I really like the grounding strategies as they are things that I feel like I can fit into my day easily, plus they give me something to focus my mind on so it wanders less than when I am just breathing. I have also found another strategy this week that is working quite well for me. I friend suggested a colouring in book for when I am stressed, and I have found that colouring in just after eating distracts me until the compulsion to eat more is gone, plus it is really relaxing.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi Ellen. I tried the confidence approach and it really helped. At first it felt very foreign and uncofortable because I've always been worried that if I become over-confident about anything I will lose the ability to push myself harder. But i think that isn't entirely right. It feels nice to believe in myself a little bit and trust that even if I went on autopilot I would probably still put my best effort into things. I guess I don't necessarily need to make it happen. I'm excited to do some more mindfulness practice. I have more free time over the weekend so will make it a goal :),,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,Hi Ellen. I am finding it really helpful trying to pin down my automatic thoughts and talk back to them. Sometimes it is hard to do in the moment though and I can only do t when I''m reflecting later. Do you have any ideas of how I can get myself talking back to them in the moment? I feel like this stage of the program is really helping me. It was a relief to hear that it is okay to have some self compassion. I was really annoyed with myself for bingeing on chocolate earlier today but then told myself it is okay to make a mistake.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"In particular I keep assigning too much meaning to my mistakes and assume that they are flaws in my character as a whole and they will keep happening forever. I know that?s not true, but it is a hard feeling to shake off. Things are really hectic with my academic work and I am feeling a lot of anxiety at the moment, but despite the stress I think I am getting a bit better at catching myself before I get stuck in those old loops :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I?ve been trying to practice cognitive reframing every so often throughout the day. The thinking errors that I am noticing the most are black and white thinking, filtering, and emotional reasoning. I guess those are my ?go to? errors.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Ellen. I've had a great weekend so far because I gave myself a whole day of break from my work. I felt the stress lift during the day, and with it the over-thinking about what I was eating. It is a relief to know that the thinking doesn't take over my life all the time anymore. I guess the challenge is to translate it though so that I am able to keep it up even when I am under a lot of pressure.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"After all, often what I want to do is the right thing and I somehow make myself prioritize other things over that because of that feeling of ?should?. What do you think? That is why I often struggle to take breaks, as I assume that I should be working. I really like your idea of planning in breaks so that they feel more intentional. You are right ? if I am taking breaks on purpose I would probably feel less guilty about them.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I also really liked the last session on special events. I find them particularly hard as there is pressure to eat things to be polite, then I end up breaking the rules I set myself, then feel guilty which triggers all of my anxiety and disordered eating. I will try to practice cognitive reframing and will also try to set more general goals like eating just one plateful rather than specific restrictions on what I can?t eat at the event.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Ellen. I realized when I read your last message that I have always lived according to what I feel I ?should? be doing, as it somehow feels more noble to push myself to do things than to do them because I want to. I did some thinking about this though, and maybe there isn?t that much wrong with doing things that I want to do.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Ellen. Looking forward to talking with you and figuring out the best way to move forward. I really want to keep up the momentum as I feel like things are getting so much better. Monday at 4:00 would be wonderful if you are still available then. I think that is 5pm my time (EDT), so I would be just home from physical therapy.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Ellen. Thank you so much for our phone conversation the other day. It was really nice to talk to you. I've had a think, and I am going to try to space out my Lantern sessions a bit like we talked about. I'll start with 3 times a week - probably Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays as those are the days when I am kept less busy and therefore tend to struggle more. Plus they are the days when I will have more time to reflect and work on things. I thought you might be happy to hear that I've been experimenting some more with the opposite action",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Neha. It?s really nice to meet you. I?m looking forward to working with you. I?ve found the support of my coaches super helpful throughout the program in encouraging me, keeping me accountable, and coming up with really good ideas to help me out. I am very excited about doing Phase 2. I am going to try to log in 2-3 times per week because I want to test out coping on my own a bit and prove that I can (to overcome the fear that I will go back to my old troubles when the program eventually ends), but I am also keen to keep up with all of the valuable things in the program. I like frequent check-ins and find open-ended questions really helpful. The kind of questions/ideas that I don?t necessarily have to respond to right away but can ponder about for a day or two are particularly great. I also would love your support whenever I hit a stuck point to help problem solve and find ways forward to reduce the chance of me getting stuck again. Thanks again for coming on board to help me! I really appreciate it. :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I think I've been doing a bit of cognitive reframing along the way this week. I found myself worried about how much work I had to do and feeling out of control and fearful that all of my old habits and loops would come straight back. But then I had a look at the evidence and realized that I have been fine lately and that I don't necessarily need to be searching for a black or white presence/absence of those behaviors (and particularly the thoughts as I have no control over what pops into my head) but that it is okay to be somewhere in between and that is definitely sustainable :),,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi Neha. Thanks for your messages. I checked in a few days in a row because life was getting stressful so it was great to have the program to use as a bit of distraction and time out. I really liked the gratitude exercises. Trying to be grateful makes me feel happy in a much more real way and doesn't feel forced or artificial like when I try to 'decide' to be happy about everything. I also loved the last session I did.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks so much for your messages Neha. Made me feel a lot better. I have definitely tended to use food as a coping mechanism - almost as a way of gaining control when I feel like things are out of control. I think I need to remind myself that this stressed feeling will pass, and that I don't necessarily need to get control of things in the moment. It has worked before, but I forgot to think that way this week. A metaphor that has really worked for me is riding a wave.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Neha. I hope you're feeling better now. I've had a really hectic week with final assignments building up and I've been slipping back into losing control of my eating really badly. Now I'm scared that I'll go back to how I was, and am also worried because of all of the thankgiving meals coming up. Do you have any ideas about how I could think about things to make it better?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think that might be the link in the chain that I could break, When I feel out of control, thinking in a different way so that I don't have to use food to make things feel better. I might even go back and check out that technique in the techniques section. Thanks for the good idea! Also thank you for that article. There were some really great tips in there and it also reminded me that I'm not alone :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I really liked the idea of the energy quadrant today. I've noticed that my energy changes a lot throughout the day and affects how focused I am and how hungry I feel etc. I'm going to have a bit more of a ponder about it and try to notice the patterns of when my energy is up and down during a typical day. Maybe that way it will be easier to accept when I feel less energetic and more tense rather than feeling bad about it :),,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Thank you so so much Neha. I really appreciate your support. You've given me a big confidence boost today.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Neha,
You?re right ? I often feel guilty when I am too proud of myself because I am scared I?ll become arrogant. I think really I?m scared that I will lose the determination to drive myself on to do better at things if I let myself be too complacent. But it does feel really nice to notice the good things that I am doing. I guess that?s okay, right? Especially if it is just boosting my self confidence rather than shouting it out to the world.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks for the reminder about my account closing day. I?m so glad I got some extended time in the programme because it has been super valuable. Thank you too for reminded me about the progress I?ve made. Sometimes it?s easy to get frustrated with myself and forget how far I?v e come. I might use the program quite often over the next few weeks as I?d love to get through lots of the content and because I will be in the middle of my final papers for school. My final papers will be quite a big stressor so I feel like planning ahead to use this program as a touchstone, plus scheduling regular breaks for myself, would be a good idea so that I don?t spiral back into any of those old habits. Then I?ll be finished my degree and I am sure I will feel pretty confident to graduate from the Lantern program too and move onwards and upwards!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Neha. I have been seeing how I do going solo for the past week and I have felt pretty good. Even though I have been in the middle of final exams I have mostly managed to keep my stress under control and I feel fairly on top of things. It?s proving to me that I?m going to be okay as long as I remember to take breaks when I need them and use the strategies I?ve learned when the anxiety builds. I?ve made a list of the strategies like we talked about and that is great to refer to. I?ve also tried some writing. I know that my account gets shut off soon, so I just want to take this moment to say an enormous thank you to you and everybody in the Lantern team for supporting me through the units and for creating a program which has made such a big difference in my life :) :) :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Caroline,
I tried to call during what I thought was our assigned time, but perhaps we got our signals crossed again. I was also a little confused about your message saying ""tomorrow"", so maybe that's why we missed each other again. I'm sorry we keep having to reschedule!
For this week, I could call between 11:45am and 12:30pm EST (8:45am and 9:30am PST) on either Thursday (5/14) or Friday (5/15). I also have some availability on Saturday (5/16) in the afternoon and evening, if that would work better.

Thank you for reaching out. Various stresses from my life made it very difficult to keep up with Lantern for these past few weeks, but I'm going to try to work with it again.
I'm sorry our first phone call didn't work out; I realized, looking back at the previous messages, that you were operating on Pacific coast time while I was thinking East coast time! No wonder we missed each other. :) I'd be happy to reschedule a phone call for this Saturday (May 9th), or sometime that following week (pretty much any day Monday May 11th through Friday May 15th).

Thanks for checking in. Things have definitely been getting busier with schoolwork picking up at the end of the semester, and I've also been a bit stressed about the logistics of my impending move back to the West Coast.

I have availability Wednesday afternoon / evening, Friday afternoon, and most of the weekend.

,,,,"Hi! I am doing much better. I have gotten lost in school. I am in the last 2 weeks of classes and it is very overwhelming. I have not been beating myself up for eating certain foods. On bad days about my body, I try to breathe and not talk down to myself. It's rough but I am getting through it. My craving for laxatives has not left but I find ways to remove myself from the thinking. Eating to self-sooth has been present occasionally but I have been able to control it or allow myself to feel what is happening.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"HI Jacqui, I tried to do my daily check in and my internet was being weird. I refreshed my page and it said done for the day but I'm not 100% sure if my answers got across.

I am unsure If I will be able to keep up the last week of June since I will be in recovery after surgery. I will be out for 4-6 weeks but will continue to stay on track.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hello! Nice to meet you Sarah. I think the gratitude exercises helps me realize that not everything is spiraling out of control and I have support and good in my life. When everything is insane I only see that but using the idea of gratitude helps calm me and be appreciative, It helps me step back form everything. My boyfriend has been my rock and I am unbelievably grateful to have him during all my struggles. My dad is doing well now, which is a relief. I plan to incorporate this during times that are emotionally overwhelming to help calm me down and realize that life is okay and not to allow myself to spiral out of control.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think it's the fact that I'm being more aware of food. Plus moving to my new house with a nicer kitchen makes it fun to cook once again. I'm trying not to beat myself up, which is the biggest thing. I cut back on the laxatives because they were hurting my stomach and lower abdomen. Purging occurs when I'm under extreme stress I realized recently. It helps me feel in more control and suppresses my appetite",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,HI Jacqui! I have been tired. Back to work and it's go go go. My boyfriend's grandfather died this week so right now I am focusing on being there for him and preparing for the funeral.

,,,,"I think it allowed me to take my mind off of food. I realized also ate when I needed to. If I was craving something, I just ate it. I realized if I didn't eat a cookie that I really wanted I would go and eat 10 other things to try to satisfy that craving for one cookie.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"I think that's the biggest thing for me, managing emotions. I sometimes don't realize what I'm doing and suddenly it dawns on me that I have eaten my feelings whether good or bad.

,,,,"Hi Jacqui, It was great chatting with you as well. It was nice knowing someone is actually out there and willing to help. Have a great day!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,It was overwhelming to do this exercise. I was looking at each part and was like where do I even begin. It was hard to look at what I could fully take control over. I knew my actions would be the beginning of a new change. Then working on my thoughts slowly as I work with my change in behavior.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I binged today to an extent. Around 4pm I just became very hungry. Like it seemed like nothing would satisfy me. I ate my dinner around 5:30 then a snack around 6:30/7. When k got home it was like I just couldn't stop. I ate a handful of tortilla chips with salsa, 1 cup of goldfish, 2 cookies, peanuts, and more. I forced myself to leave the kitchen. I can't figure out why I became so hungry. I haven't been like this in a while so I'm wondering if it's stress or something else. I thought I had a breakthrough today. I told myself that as long as I stay under 300lbs then I am content. I saw it as a way to help me not beat myself for gaining a pound or two. I just feel a bit guilty for what I did tonight and confused by what brough it on.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I felt relaxed after practicing. Additionally with having a cold it allowed me to calm down and not feel stressed. I think I can use this in times where I feel like bingeing. This may allow me to pause and take a step back.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,I think my biggest concern is that I will gain weight and not look good in my clothes. I can normally tell if I have gained weight by how my clothes are fitting me. I become very body conscious and then a little paranoid that people have noticed my weight gain,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Jacqui. Sorry I haven't been responding as much as I have been. It is finals time and I am swamped with work for classes. During this time I have been focusing on not binging and eating balanced meals. It's been good so far. The only thing I am lacking is sleep, which makes me crave food so much so I am being cautious of that. I hope all is well for you. This last exercise, which made me look at what I value within myself was really good. I realized being a good friend and my intelligence was much more important to me than my body. It was relieving to know I was able to set this idea aside of my body being what defines me.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hello! I finally got some down time. I took my boyfriend to meet my family and it seemed to all go well. I noticed that I was able to remain calm and didn't eat out of stress and anxiety. It was nice to see and feel that change. Hope all is going well for you!,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I woke up this morning feeling gross. I started to knit pick at my body. I decided I would weigh myself. I was at 299.5 lbs. Still under my 300lb limit but it scared me. I just never thought I would get that close to that number. I wanted to cry and scream. My appetite shut down and food was a complete turn off. I barely ate breakfast and I am frustrated and angry. Since September, when my dad went into the hospital, I have gained almost 20lbs. I hate it. Every time I feel like I may be able to get back to a healthy place something happens and I just gain. I don't have time for the gym and I don't like it. I wish I had consistency",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,My friends know that I struggle but I'm rarely candid. I let them see my anger and frustration. I got hugs and kind words. It was just nice having them listen and support me,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Jacqui! I'm doing better. I had a rough time the day I reached out to you. I finally opened up and talked about my feelings not only with you but with some friends. I had a woman at the grocery store look at my ID and go ""woooow! You've lost so much weight. You go girl."" It was kind of a smack upside the head to remind myself how much progress I've made. It helped me feel a better about my weight. Additionally, my boss gave me a simple work schedule that allows me to focus on myself and school more this next quarter and I'm happy about that. I decided not to ask for more hours. I knew I needed to take care of myself and that's priority over work. 

Hope all is well for you.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,It really is. It also sucks because I educate others so much and it always finds a way to come back to me. It's refreshing they're taking stuff to heart. Plus they also genuinely care about me and my health,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you. I did that and wen't through a half day starving myself period. I talked to one of my friends about what I was doing and she said, ""You always tell me not to starve myself because the body does what?"" Then I explained how it then holds onto fat whenever you eat and blah blah blah. She used my own psych stuff on me, which was very nice.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hello! I enjoyed the mirror mirror exercise. I've done an exercise like it in the past. It was hard to stare at myself because I remember what my body looked like before I gained the 20 pounds. I became increasingly frustrated. I have a hard time staying calm with stuff. I tend to react quickly and it turns into me over compensating. I try to take a deep breath but I still freak out,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Jacqui! I thought I answered your question but forgot to press send. I think I'm afraid to say ""no"" because I don't know how to. I'm also scared people may not like me and get upset. Id rather have people like me than ""disown"" me. I'm trying to say no and learn to be comfortable with it.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,I have been able to say no to my mom and dad when it comes to food but I believe that's because I am trying to be a role model for them. They both have unhealthy eating habits. I think the real challenge is saying no to my friends and boyfriend.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I did have regular meals throughout the morning. I even made sure to snack. I was just extremely emotional. I was tired and didn't want to go t the gym. I was like I will do my chores at home in place of the gym. I just ended up sitting there and eating. Doing that made me hate myself and cry. I will admit this because I am working on being honest with myself and others, I had actually started using laxatives this last week to do with how I was feeling about my body. I had been hiding from doing check-ins because I was embarrassed to admit it. I finally opened up this weekend and realized I had to stop and get help. This meant I need to dedicate myself to doing check-ins and the program here along with receiving outside therapy. I normally kept this information private until I became ill but I knew I couldn't keep this quiet.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Jacqui, 

I hope you have a good weekend as well. I found myself skipping the gym today because I was tired and wanted to relax. From the moment I got home I just kept snacking. I'm not sitting here still hungry and want to cry because there's no reason to be hungry. I'm finding myself frustrated and wondering why this is happening. My frustration makes me want to cry because I'm tired of dealing with this bottomless pit feeling.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Thank you. I just new it was wrong. I have been trying to be more open and honest. I have a very hard time reaching out for help. I knew I had to or else I was going to end up very sick again.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I found myself becoming more present using the technique. It helped me calm down and allowed my mind to, in some sense, go blank. I think this will really help me in the future. As long as I remember to use it.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I actually used it yesterday. I was sitting at Starbucks are really craving a pastry but I knew I didn't need and I wasn't hungry. I ended up sitting and listening to peaceful music while making sure to hold onto my book and deep breathe. I allowed myself to get out of my head and just calm down. It was great and I was able to avoid the food.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I really needed it this evening. I found myself snacking a lot this evening. I even found myself sneaking food. I finally walked away and sat down. I think it may have been because there's been tension between my dad and I. We haven't talked about anything and I'm unsure what's going on. I have forced myself to sit in my room and not eat anything. I know if I do eat, I'll regret it because it's emotional eating.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I will definitely have to start using it. I had another incident of snacking today, which made me full and unable to eat dinner. I found myself just eating hummus, broccoli, turkey lunch meat, and topped it all off with a bowl of cereal. 

Plus I've been craving laxatives. I haven't been going to the bathroom normally and it's bothering me. I know a lot of it has to do with my body getting used to no laxatives but it's creepy how my mind always wanders to them.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I've been finding it helpful in moments where cravings for food and crave for laxatives are present,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Self-criticism is an effective motivator. That really stood out to me. I see myself criticizing and then going, ""Now's your chance to make the changes."" But I still hate myself and I am still feeling depressed",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I think how critical I am of my body. That is something that really stood out to me. Plus I only focus on my stomach area. That is a big deal for me. When I am sitting I focus a lot of my legs.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I compare myself to girls that are half my size. I know realistically that I will never be there size but it eats away at me. I start to hate myself. I begin to give up on eating healthy because what's the point. I feel undermined b their bodies and looks,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think trying to be mindful and having self-compassion. Looking at my body for what it is, not it's flaws. It's a rough road but I am trying. I have a wonderful boyfriend who says he loves my body no matter what so in some sense, that helps me stay grounded.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think it was from doing a lot of therapy. I was in an 8 hour therapy group one Saturday. I also spent time with my boyfriend. I just spent a lot of time discussing issues, fears, anxiety. Letting it out helped me relax and not turn to food as often.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,I think my boyfriend helps a lot. He allows me to be vulnerable and just say how I feel. I get embarrassed but he reassures me to keep going. In therapy it takes me a while to open up and sometimes I have to be forced.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I noticed that some of the stuff was irrational and unrealistic. I knew what I needed to do to combat how I was feeling. It made me really question whether or not it was true.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think that is an issue while doing the sessions. I can still ""feel"" how these beliefs are relevant even though logically and can see how they are not. It's comforting be reassured that its okay to feel like that",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Jacqui, I didn't get an update that you messaged me 6 days ago. Thank you for checking in and your kind words. My dad was released today and he is now back home. He still has a cough but he's so happy to be back here. I struggled a little this past week but I told myself not to beat myself up over things I ate or how I handled everything. I just let it happen. Turns out I made good decisions and didn't gain any weight. Hope all is well for you!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,I just tried to make sure I didn't beat myself up. My habits have been off lately but I am trying to get back on track with just healthier choices.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hello, I have been better, I was diagnosed with strep throat last week. I am getting better though. My dad is currently in the hospital and is now being moved to an assisted living facility.

Other than that I have been patient with myself during this rough time.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I did notice that I was able to be less aggressive and more calm when trying to be open-minded. I have definitely been trying to do this with people since I am under so much stress right now.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank for letting me know Jacqui! Hope all is well for you. My dad is heavily sedated do to his pain level. I hope he comes out of it soon. I am in full swing with school, work, and my internship. Trying to stay focused and do some self-care. A lot easier said than done. I did decide to skip a weekend away for an event and just focus on me. Baby steps I guess.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

I'm glad to see one month is left. I hope to be able to finish it. As of today, my father passed away. I hope to continue after my mourning and services.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Jacqui, Thank you so much for the update. I was so happy to be a part of this. Honestly without this program, I would have not made it through my father's passing. This program gave me tools to help me and I am so grateful for that. I shall finish this week up. An in person phone call is fine. What days and times are you available? Then I can look at my schedule. :)",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey , I am really sorry . I just found the message button . Until now I did not realize you were sending actual messages . I thought the daily reminder was your message. I will be free for a call next weekend. Also I wanted to ask- Yesterday I planned some my meals for today. And I was supposed to get reminders today. And I didn't . I can't remember some of the snacks that I enlisted.
If I start losing weight - I would feel more confident of my method and know for sure that it works on my body. I would feel more disciplined and in control of myself. Every time I see someone on TV eating something that looks visually yummy, I crave for it without being hungry. I want to be able to ignore all that. If I manage to lose at least 25 pounds this year , I would feel very proud and relieved. I would not feel like slacking so often because my weight would not be on a standstill anymore. And yes , I have realized that I eat better when I am with my family. But I live alone. Its easier for me to lose control. Now that I know, I am going to work harder on that tendency.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,HI! Thank you for checking in with me. I've been busy with travel for the past while. Interest is still there!,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I feel that having control is correlated with body image since that is the way our bodies have been created. Everything is controllable if you are willing to believe that. Also, when I am ""out-of-control,"" I feel like I solely act on my feelings and worries which will cause me to lose control. I guess the ways to feel in control are what I have seen in this program (such as mediation, breathing etc). Also, the mirror image exercise was not too helpful since It was hard to do the exercise for more than 5 minutes. And a matcha affogato is a dessert, vanilla ice cream with matcha poured over (similar to the European expresso poured over ice cream). It was a nice guilt treat :D",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"One technique that helped a lot were the ""break the chain"" and the tips about what to do when you are anxious or stressed. I have been using them this week to avoid ""boredom eating."" One way I think would prevent this ""boredom eating"" is to keep my mind occupied by doing something else. Another helpful way was to study with friends since I am much more likely to not binge eat around them.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hello Elisa, the self esteem exercise was really great. It made me think of all the good things I actually am instead of comparing myself to others all the time. For my body image check in, I feel that my body image is the lowest where I have the least control. My highest body image is where I have the most control. However, this program is enabling me to work on my ""eating"" part so I can have a higher body image.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes, I actually learned a bit of the set point concept in my biology and general psychology classes but did not realize that it was pretty important! I think it was mainly since our professors kept emphasizing that genetics do not dictate you completely and you have the power to change which is why I do believe we have control. But now I do know that we have control but not completely since it can be controlled by genetics as well.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Additionally, this week is going pretty okay so far. I feel this week is a ""test"" week since I have finals coming up next week and a considerable amount of stress, but I am managing well with the new techniques I learned here! (:",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"being a mom I could really relate to what I would want for a child in my care. And I thought a lot about why I wouldn't do the same for myself. I don't really have a lot of answers for that, but it seems to be very important. what do you think?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"she has been struggling with prescription drug use, and my brother and I had to stage an intervention for her in January. She has done a lot of lying or telling me things I want to hear, and since she is under financial pressure I am concerned she is just playing me.

,,,,It is a helpful tool. I think with practice I can make it more of a habit which in turn will help my mood improve.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,thank you for your support. I have been struggling with a lot of family issues since my father died last year. A lot of my family members fell apart. I did too a little bit. Maybe that's why my food issues came back on so strong.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I do think so. Coming from a pretty dysfunctional family, typically the cognitive distortions make sense and are true when they are in relation to dysfunctional people. At least that is my experience. I run into problems when I assume these same ways of thinking with people who are not like my family. Does that make sense?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"This is my last year of school, but when I have assignments or exams. It's hard to balance school with my home life (I have 3 kids) sometimes.

Even when I go to the community center or our kids' school my husband reminds me not to sign up for anything. I overwhelm myself and get stressed and then I comfort eat/emotionally overeat.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"I have been in class most of the summer, actually.

,,,,"i have been on break from school and classes started this week. I have been feeling pretty anxious about things, and using food to ""comfort"" myself. perhaps the grounding exercise could help in addition to the positive activities skill. When i am pressed for time it is tough to justify to myself to make time for these things too, but I guess it will be worth it.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,She encouraged me to re-connect because you guys understand what folks with eating issues go through. I am hoping by reconnecting something will help me.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

I have been really struggling these past couple of weeks.

I do think I need to learn how to reach out for support more. Perhaps this is something I can work on during this program too.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,no. no vomiting. that must have been a mistake. that is not the way I compensate for overeating. I use exercise and dieting.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

,,,,"thanks for checking in with me. i have been struggling this week with food. I just can't seem to get down time from my responsibilities. I end up feeling wiped out and end up bingeing. the past two days have been better. I have been trying to lay off of the dieting and eating more intuitively. However, I still find that after I eat to fullness, I still feel compelled to calculate my calories.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I am not sure what you can do. I am just sharing, and maybe if you have any pointers that might be helpful for you to share.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes. that seems to make sense. It can be easy to forget to have fun everyday, because I get caught up in being productive. I will try at least once this week to plan ""fun"" time.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I also wanted to apologize for not being on the program in a long time. I have been feeling stuck, because I didn't see myself improving. I kept having to report ""binges,"" and I didn't want to do that. So I spaced out checking in between sessions until I had a ""good day,"" but what happened was that the days got farther and farther apart. I guess you can see that perfectionism is an issue for me. It sounds silly, but having to report that everyday was like failing everyday.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"So I would get in this vicious cycle of not logging in, telling myself tomorrow I would have a ""good day, "" by staying within my calorie allowance. By the end of the day I go over my budget, and it starts all over again.

,,,,"I have heard of self-care, and i think this program covered self-care already but it was nice to hear again. I liked the reducing events that trigger painful emotions, because it was kind of a new twist to something I know already, and was opposite to what I thought to be true. We also have discussed scheduling positive activities, which I liked.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

I haven't exercised in an entire year and I think that's really hurting not only my body image but my physical health. I know that if I were to exercise, a lot of my problems would go away. Problem is, I don't know how to exercise and I also don't have time to exercise. By ""no time to exercise,"" I mean that I'm lazy... and I don't know how to change that :(",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Caroline, it's totally fine! I've been awful with logging on anyway. My biggest issue is just that I'm lazy. I don't know how to not be lazy, either. Now that finals are over and I'm at home, I've been trying to get myself to exercise. I totally CAN because I have equipment and everything (I didn't at school) but instead I'm lying in bed watching Netflix when I'm not working. I feel super guilty about it too, which makes me want to lie in bed even more :(",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It wasn't good... I gained at least 10 pounds from what I thought my weight was, but only 5 from the time I last weighed myself (a few months ago). This is leading me to think that I am actually gaining weight and it's not just a fluctuation in my weight :(",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also... Last summer I malingered to get my doctor to prescribe an anti-seizure medication that had weight loss as a side effect. I know that's awful but I was really desperate to lose weight. It really messed with my mood and emotions so I had to stop taking it, but this summer I've noticed random mood swings, followed by cravings for the medication. Is this normal?",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Okay, I take back what I said about being better. I'm actually getting a lot worse, I just blew up at my boyfriend and my best friend and I think it's cause my cognitive and emotional abilities are severely impaired right now -- I skipped dinner yesterday and threw up dinner tonight and all I care about right now is not eating food",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"So I realized that my eating habits are a lot healthier and more stable when I'm not in school. Over the summer I'm at home, where my parents cook for me and I actually time to exercise. I'm also not stressed and around people who I can constantly compare myself to, and it feels great! I feel healthy (for the most part) so right now it's hard for me to log stuff on Lantern. But I know that once I start school again I'll go back into my negative habits",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Sorry I panicked last night :(
I'm not seeing a psychologist at the moment. I don't normally have freak outs like that",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Caroline, 

Sorry for the slow response. I'm still interested in continuing, I just felt bad and embarrassed about my previous messages to you (the ones where I had a mini meltdown). I've gotten a lot better recently with my body image because I've been exercising lately (finally!) and it's helping a lot.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Alina! It's nice to meet you! I really enjoyed working with Caroline and I wish her the best with her future endeavors in life. Thanks for stepping up and taking over for her! It's really helpful to have a coach. I'll go ahead and explain my log-in patterns and use of the program really quick, just because it might be helpful to keep in mind. I feel the most vulnerable in terms of body image when I'm in a college environment, stressed, or when I know I'll have to wear a bikini or tight fitting clothing. I've been healthy for the most part over the summer because I'm a lot more relaxed and I have time to focus on healthy behaviors. I also am using a habit tracking app to force myself to exercise and eat healthier every day. These behaviors make me feel positively about my body image.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I don't log on when I feel I don't need to, but every now and then, I'll have another binge eating or vomiting episode. I mentioned this to Caroline, but my family isn't supportive or helpful about this. I'm Chinese, and in China, people are openly critical of weight. For example, once I went to a store in China and tried on a dress, only to put it back on the rack because I didn't like the style. My uncle yelled to the entire store about how I was too fat to fit in the dress. Little things like that happened a lot throughout my childhood, and my parents, despite having lived in America for a long time, aren't always careful with what they say.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I also mentioned this to Caroline, but the most supportive figure I have in my life when it comes to eating and body image is my boyfriend. He's also helped a lot to stop my negative behaviors, which is another reason why I haven't been logging on much. I'd really like to log on more frequently, because I might be okay temporarily, but I know one day I'll have another episode.

Sorry that was a ton of information all at once! Let me know if I can clarify anything, or if you have any questions.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Caroline, so sorry for not logging on more regularly! It's finals season so I've been all over the place. I've been feeling extra bloated and overweight lately so it's also been lately to focus on positive body image. I know that's the most critical time to use Lantern, but I feel embarrassed that I'm having these issues.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Caroline! Sorry for the lack of messages and for being MIA the past month. I'm free to talk on the phone today between 2 PM and 8 PM. I won't have much time this weekend but if today doesn't work for you, we can try next week?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also, today's lesson is about weighing yourself and I can't bring myself to weigh myself and log my weight. What should I do?",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm trying to log on more often. I can talk on the phone today from 4 to 5:30 PM central time or tomorrow (Friday) from 12 PM to 2 PM central time. If those times don't work, let me know and I can send you more available times.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"That makes me a LOT less likely to ""spiral out of control"" or have really intense emotional episodes due to eating issues. I haven't had one since I started tracking my habits/tasks!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'll get back to you about the phone call this Wednesday -- because I'm on vacation, I don't have my planner with me. Sorry for the delay!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Alina, I'm so so SO sorry I haven't been responsive at all! Everything has been fine, but transitioning back to school has been so hectic, I haven't gotten on Lantern. I finally have my schedule down and all my tasks/events saved in my planner, so I'm back into the swing of things. Once again, so sorry I've been really bad at logging on.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"That being said, I still understand the importance of logging on to Lantern on a daily basis. I'll add a habit on Habitica to log on!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Sorry for all the messages; it's hard to type one long message. I've narrowed down my body issues to two things: 1. I'm terrified of weighing myself. I refuse to do it. When I'm at the doctor's and they weigh me, I have to look away while they do it. I'm scared because I'd rather not know how much I weigh, since I seem to keep gaining weight.
2. I don't eat lunch or dinner some days due to a super busy class schedule. Some days, I'm in class/busy from 11:30 AM to 10 PM with only 1.5 hours of free time.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm planning on leaving snacks in my backpack or making myself go to the cafe to get food between classes (i have a few breaks). I'll try that out and let you know how it goes. As for the vomiting, I haven't done it in a long time and I didn't force myself to; I felt super nauseous from eating food (and I couldn't tell if it was because of what I ate or if I felt like I ate too much. Either way, I felt super super full and really nauseous). Should I not have recorded it as vomiting if it wasn't necessarily voluntary?",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"In response to your questions, yes, I find myself comparing my body to those around me, especially while walking to class. In terms of the habit tracking app, I have an account on Habitica, an app designed to gamify your life in terms of habits and tasks. It allows me to track positive and negative habits (i.e. positive: ""Eat a salad,"" negative: ""Take the elevator""). It's really helpful and it's actually helped a lot with any eating problems I've had because being organized makes me feel so much more in control of my life.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"No worries about response time! I'm super bad at responding anyway. Yes, I'd love to have help with figuring out when to eat. I seem to struggle with sticking to an eating schedule, cause it's silly to me that I have to remember to eat (outside of college I always eat normally). The forbidden foods section was interesting, but I don't know how helpful it is because I have foods that I are ""forbidden"" but I lack the self control to actually not eat them. I haven't had a chance to test it out yet since I'm on vacation right now",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I've been staying up because I've been too productive to go to bed (which is great, but I only start getting productive around 2 AM....). Stress and sleep deprivation make me more likely to eat junk food :( And yeah, talk to you tomorrow!!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'll give you a call at that number this Friday at 8 AM PST! Other barriers that make it difficult for me to consistently eat snacks include stress from classes and sleep deprivation. Lately, I've been staying up working on homework (even when I don't have to).

My thoughts on the positive thoughts session are that it was helpful and insightful! It's not something I think about everyday but now that it's in the back of my mind, I feel a LOT less guilty for hanging out with friends",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Just finished the Grounding Tools... i loved them! My favorite technique so far. Definitely really helpful and applicable,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I liked that it reassured me that it was okay to feel my emotions. And I liked the list of emotions to choose from, because it helped me figure out exactly how I was feeling. The opposite action part was super helpful too; today, I felt stressed and guilty, and instead of lying in bed, I thought of my Lantern session and forced myself to do work to tackle that stress. :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also, I don't know if this is just a glitch but I'm not getting the question about how many meals I'm eating a day anymore. Either way, I think it's really helpful to leave that question out since it was always hard for me to remember all the meals I ate, and how far back 24 hours goes",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,I really really like these sections! Very helpful and one of the most relevant sections to me so far,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I don't like the mirror mirror exercise... I know it should be beneficial, but it doesn't help me that much because I generally like what I see in the mirror, yet still feel my body isn't as attractive as I want it to be. The avoidance section was relevant! I still haven't weighed myself yet, though I haven't had a reason to",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also the section on automatic thoughts was creepily relevant... I spent my entire day thinking and telling my friends ""my life is a mess,"" and the example that came up about the job interview/rejection was super relevant, as I'm applying to jobs right now and dealing with rejection is something I really really really need to learn. I currently have automatic thoughts in reaction to rejection, and these thoughts turn into really damaging self-views",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Wow, I really love the automatic thoughts material. Most relevant thing I've had in Lantern so far. This is something I've been wanting to work on for so long now",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I was aware in the moment, and even tried to limit the number of times I said that to people",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yeah, actually I do most of the logical errors (sadly). That's also why this material is super relevant. Also, I loved the cognitive reframing technique. Exactly what I needed!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"That actually is a great suggestion, thanks for bringing it up! I was trying to think of a way to reword the sentence but I couldn't, so that's why my anxiety level stayed the same",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Ooh oh my gosh I love the elephant rider metaphor for cognitive reframing!,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also today I found out that I wasn't called back for an interview for a job I really wanted, and I immediately started blaming myself and personalizing, but then instantly realized I was having automatic thoughts. This is super helpful :)",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,It's hard coming up with a balanced thought. Also I feel like I'm still bad at categorizing logical errors,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Thanks for the help! I'll try to incorporate both sides of the argument in my balanced statement,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you! That means a lot to me. And yes, my eating patterns have been irregular lately due to stress. I pulled an all-nighter earlier this week for a project, which has seriously hurt my health/wellbeing for the past few days. I've also been so busy that I forget to eat :(",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"That's good to keep in mind. It's kind of a cycle, where I don't eat because I don't have time, but then I run out of time to do things because I'm too exhausted to do them. It's hard to get out :(",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"A hobby would be great during times of stress, but I don't have any that I keep up with. For example, I used to play piano, but I can't fit a piano in a dorm room. Any suggestions?",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I like painting. It calms me down but it takes a long time, so that's not the best option. I'd like to get into a new, unique hobby that I can focus on though!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also just a heads up, I indicated that I vomited once in today's check-in because I drank too much, not because I voluntarily threw up (though in the back of my mind I was happy that I threw up my dinner...)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Just emailed the screenshot! Not sure exactly what hobbies are good, but I've always wanted to juggle. Knitting/crocheting is also a good one. The ""anticipating what's ahead"" section was good but I'm worried about the future and what to do after Lantern. One of my favorite things about Lantern is the implicit and explicit support system. Implicit because I know that there's a program that I can log my feelings into, and explicit because of you :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Thanks! And not yet. Though my boyfriend is helping a lot with this. I told him about the things I've learned in Lantern and he reminds me when I'm having automatic thoughts. It's super helpful,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Other outlets include writing, playing the piano, and poetry. Explicit support: my boyfriend",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Okay! I'd like to check in more often then in order to get the most out of Lantern. :),,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi Alina! Reframing has gotten easier with practice,,,,,none,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It's good! I need to work on finding better, more relevant core beliefs to try these techniques on",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Alina, I'm SO so sorry about that. I totally blanked and forgot to call (I had just heard back about the job interview and was distracted). I deeply apologize.",,,,,none,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I ended up getting the job! So I've been a lot happier and relaxed lately. The ""three good things"" section is helpful in that it lets me focus on the good in my life!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Thank you! We go through school straight in the summer. It's been a huge adjustment period swapping to patient care for me from pure academic studies. I'm looking forward to getting back into using the app and working on my body image.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi. I've been doing well. Very busy with the end of the semester at school, but I haven't been binging and have been exercising so I'm feeling good.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I like this breathing technique better. The 4-7-8 was somewhat difficult to me. This one is more doable.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi Jacqui I've actually been pretty sick since about April and haven't had the chance to log in. Now that I've been feeling better I will be getting back into this.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I think it would help when I'm feeling overwhelmed and yes the first half has so far been great,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,off and on I haven't been feeling great but I'm trying to put a reminder to keep up with this. Its something I think has helped me and I need to take part even if I'm not feeling great,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,For self esteem I'm not really sure. I work with quite a few high school and middle schoolers so I know that having a good self-esteem. I try to demonstrate what that looks like when I meet with them to show this is something that is important.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi sorry I've had problems in my personal life and I've been pretty disconnected for the last few days. As far as challenging no I haven't had any challenges with eating this week. I did start a diet or well more of a portion control thing. So far that is going good.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I can say the breathing technique seems to really help. I've had a lot of anxiety lately which has given me trouble with eating. The breathing technique did help with the anxiety and help really quick.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi there's definitely been a few things to keeping from logging in. But I'm able to get back on track now. Unfortunately I no longer have a phone so I can only communicate though this now.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,What I really liked about this is that is felt similar to meditating. Kind of looking for the positives and when negatives come in to kind of let them float away. I did have a few things that bothered me but in the end I came back with a really positive outlook. Of all exercises I think this was probably my favorite,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I've been working on trying to push away from the food and kind of think before eating,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,it ended up not being a problem I took the time to enjoy them and still only eat enough to enjoy and not overdue,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,When I tried the grounding I was just relaxing. So far it isn't much of a help but I still plan to practice to give a bit more of a try,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,yes I saw and I hope to be on here everyday to finish,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,to me I think its kind of a good way to think about what my emotions are. Along with identifying them also figuring out what is causing them.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,It actually felt good to kind of break it down and realize that,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"In regard to your first question, I really don't reach out to people much about this. I am a normal weight, but go through periods of binging to the point where I am extremely discomfortable because I have eaten so much food. I guess I am afraid it will change my friends perception of me, which I really don't want. I know my mom has know for a couple years, but she and I have never seen eye to eye on it. Over the years, I have realized my mom has disordered eating too, more towards the anorexia side, but fails to recognize it as abnormal eating behavior. She says it is ""normal for girls who want to be thin""
In regard to your second question, yes this program has helped me a lot. I think because I have to check in and report, I realize it feels good when I can put I did not binge today. Also, the exercises help me too, especially the chain event one!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think it will help because I know for me there is a point before I binge where I can still can walk away and not binge eat. So, if I learn to pause and see how I am feeling, I feel i could prevent me from binge eating.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I found it insight because I never thought of the cycle like a chain. It made me understand it better.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Where my self esteem lies and how I view myself really does affect how I feel.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think it was helpful because I got to see what emotions make up my personality and drive me to binge eat. It is something I never put much thought into, but I think in the long run will help me with my emotions.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,It definitely put light to how much I negatively think about myself and how it really is unnecessary and not true,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey Caroline, sorry it's been a few weeks since I've logged in! I've been busy with school and I got my wisdom teeth pulled out. But so far everything has been going smoothly, I'm home now and haven't binged for about two weeks. Thanks for checking in on me.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Okay thanks! Regarding your message before that one, I went home for a week for spring break and it defiantly helped re-regulate my eating patterns. It also made me realize what I eat has a direct correlation to my body and so by putting in huge amounts of calories and bad nutrition in I wouldn't feel good later. So before each time I ate I made sure what I was eating had good nutritional information and to stop eating when I felt a binge coming on. And that has helped a lot",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi thank you so much for spending your time with me. I'm glad I'm doing this because I feel embarrassed about my eating habits and haven't told anyone. I'm a college athlete and studying nutrition and feel terrible about myself. I can't seem to break these habits and I didn't know what else to do. My eating habits have been problematic for a few years now.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Things are going fairly well. My mindset is beginning to change; however I will still find myself binging but I think the amount of times I do has gotten better. These past few days I have seen the most change!,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Caroline! I received a concussion on Thursday and haven't been looking much on my computer. I'm still not feeling great, when I find a good time within the next 2 weeks I will let you know!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Alina, I had not have time to log on and I thought my behaviors were controlled well. However, I have found myself binge eating a few times the past month. I am extremely disappointed in myself, and I will finish out the program in hope to help eliminate these behaviors.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My goals were to stop brings eating and to start feeling better about my eating habits. Yes I do not want to gain weight which is why I restrict my eating, and might set me up for another binge.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes I find myself restricting after binging. I am a Nutrition Major at my university, which is why I am so embarrassed to binge eat! I study the psychological impacts that it has and yet still find myself doing it. I know if I continuously exceed my caloric intake then it will lead to gradual weight gain which I don't want to occur. Which leads to restricting my meals later in the day.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Honestly I like the cognitive reframing lessons at first but after a while it got old, I realized that a lot of the times stress comes from over thinking the situation. Also for my sport I have been traveling a lot, and have not been alone so the binge eating has diminished significantly, compared to what it used to be.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes! and I encountered a ""setback"" yesterday. I failed a biochem test and felt awful, to cope I cooked 1/4 yam, 1/2 cup brussel sprouts with avocado and tomato slices. Instead of eating unhealthy and binging",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I also was not home alone, and ate in my roommates room.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you, I have fell back into some habits, but not as often as it has been. However, I am finding other ways to keep busy and doing other things. Also I told my roommate, and closest friend about my condition and I think she will encourage me throughout this process.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Caroline, I have only seen my counselor once and we talked for about an hour. Although it was nice to have an experienced psychologist to talk to, I felt like we weren't going fast enough or addressing the issues I wanted enough. So instead, I'm reading some books on the topic to deepen my knowledge, which I really prefer because I can go at my own pace and I still get the plethora of information about my condition. I can be available Tues, May 12 at 6:30 PM to talk.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Caroline,
I have a gap of time MWF between 1 & 4 that would work best for me. Otherwise anytime on the weekend works well. I have stabilized my eating habits more since cutting down on weed and really thinking about my binging behaviors before it happens. I think in my mind as long as the food I binge on is healthy, I don't need to vomit or use laxatives because the food is benefitting my body in some way. But as soon as that food becomes unhealthy, such as sweets or fatty foods, I feel the need to expel them, which I have cut back on significantly since removing myself from those situations where the food is present.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,I have already taken initiative and am seeing a counselor through the university program.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I can do that, I agree. I'm definitely trying to improve so I'm willing to do what it takes to move forward. Thank you so much again!!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,Do you think I'll be able to finish with the time I have remaining? Would there be a way to extend the time if not?,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I want to use the app but was never able to get it to work on my phone. It would be super helpful to though! I really like the mindfulness techniques! The one yesterday was especially great!,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I really like the cognitive reframing concept! I haven't filled it out fully since I've been pretty calm while doing the sessions, but it looks like a great tool.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"They are definitely good tips, but not new information for me since that's my career! I'm sure they're very useful for other people though",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I've been doing a lot of this type of thinking before the exercises too, I just have a hard time believing my logical thoughts over my emotional ones. Hope you had a good weekend!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,Yes I like that technique a lot! Doable and beneficial!,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi, thanks! yes I'll do the 15 min call, let me know what some good times are. I've liked having the program so far! -- kind of as a comfort that I'm trying something about it more than anything",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi! Sorry, could you give a few new times next week that could work? Thank you! I did feel like I liked eating 3 bigger more regular meals without a bunch of snacks. On a daily basis though I still snack to 'energize' for something, whether or not my body feels like it's lacking energy, mentally I think that.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'd be happy to still have a call if that works! I can kind of lay out my goals for the prigram here though.. My main goal is to regain control over eating. I actually have a fairly positive body image but because I binge eat sometimes (and otherwise, even if not binging, just don't feel like I have any control or willpower over food, like when it's there, I eat it), i feel like I'm sort of barely hanging on to the body that I have, which is healthy and i generally like. The binge eating makes me feel out of control and like it's all very anxious, so even if it had nothing to do with body stuff, I don't want those feelings. Second, I think even though I have a pretty positive body image, I don't like that beauty or appearance, including of my body, feels like way too much of my sense of personal value or self worth.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I've been really liking the parts recently though about logical errors and cognitive reframing -- I had learned about those in a class but it was helpful to go through the exercises, answering the questions. I liked it too because I could do it about other things I feel anxiety about often, since I don't have the work anxiety/binge eating thing going on much right now. So I felt like it really applied to other anxiety and was helpful and hopefully I'll be able to use it if I have the work anxiety/binge eating thing when work starts back up again.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi! Nice to meet you Alina. My reasons for joining were mainly because when I felt anxious (usually at home alone with significant school work to do), I would binge eat, almost like I 'needed' it to get started on a challenging project. I've felt a lot better with that recently, but have also been out of school so it's beena different routine/environment. So I'm excited to see if I stay more balanced with it once I get back to school/work in October.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi! 
I am definitely concerned about eating habits changing when i get back to school. Even now on break it feels like when i have some other random work to do i can feel the same feeling, like anxiety/wanting to procrastinate by snacking.. I'm hoping that having this program while i'm getting back into school work will help, it really helped last spring when i started while i was in school, and then when my schedule changed i wasn't signing in quite as much over the summer.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also, one question about the cognitive reframing exercises -- it seemed like it worked so well when the program was guiding me through the steps, and i was writing in each step -- hopefully i'll be able to do this on my own, but after the program, do we get to save any of the techniques or the ways that it stepped through reframing and stuff like that?",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi!
I think I was feeling fairly good anxiety-wise before i started it, so it didn't change too much, but it still felt like a good exercise. i also started journaling this week which i really like so far, and i think will be an easier way for me to make sure i practice some cognitive reframing within that. otherwise, i don't think i'd remember to catch some of those automatic thoughts or reframe them while just thinking, but when i'm writing down thoughts, it kind of jumps out at me when i clearly use one of the logical errors.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Maybe a weekend trip for a friends birthday in a week and a half, kind of a special event...i'm not sure how to plan for both that it is kind of a special event type of thing and also traveling, combined",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I haven't done the hour at the start of the day, but I've done the activities that I want to do during it (like journaling), just at other times during the day -- but I was still kind of on vacation schedule, so now that a real schedule starts on Monday, I'm excited to start doing the real hour that I want to do at the start of the day.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"hi! thanks! i leave for the friend's weekend birthday celebration trip on friday -- i'm still not completely sure what tactics to use on that one. maybe waking up before people to do the journaling so that at least that stays consistent, but i'm not sure about being able to control the eating and drinking.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"And then snacking while leaving the house in the morning -- that's exactly (what you said) the purpose it serves. maybe if i had something like a water/coffee bottle that i could leave the house with tea or fruit infused water would kind of satisfy the same thing, like having something comforting with me as i leave.. or i've thought about doing something before leaving like a 2 minute yoga pose or mindful exercise or like, pushups or something -- that can help me feel like i have a little power routine before i go..that would take some effort to do that instead of the easy snack grab..",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I felt like the core beliefs one was a little challenging -- i think that is right, but it doesn't feel like that core belief is necessarily what's behind the anxiety that i have..maybe i had the wrong starting point, but i can see how i could apply the technique to a different thought..",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi! Oops didn't get to this in a bit, but I really liked this session about gratitude.. I feel like that's one thing I'm really good at being mindful about but I liked the added part about why the things happened, I'm going to try to add that to when I think about being grateful.
Eating-wise lately I've felt pretty happy that even though I'm back to a busy class+work schedule I haven't felt the bingeing come back! I have definitely had unhealthy/extra snacks in a comfort kind of way, but not too often and I haven't had any days recently where i felt completely out of control. I haven't felt totally in control -- like when there's food in front of me I'll pretty much eat it -- but i haven't really been thinking too much about food, which feels pretty good.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"i think mainly i just forget to sign on to use the actual exercises/techniques, but when i do within the program i find them really helpful. 
i forget, do i get access to the techniques after it's over but just no new content, or no access at all?",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"i said 1 binge in this last eating check in, but i've noticed that even when i do check that i've had one time bingeing, that actual incident is soo much better/not nearly as out of control as when i started this whole thing. it probably wouldn't have even 'counted' as one before when i had other times when i felt more out of control.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Is there any possible way to get just the text of the final units? the explanations are all so helpful and are things I go back to. Any way?,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Alina! I'm bummed I haven't been signing on at all for the end of my program, i'm so glad I finally sat down to this today because i'm writing down a whole bunch of stuff from the techniques to note for myself. It's been super useful, i'm bummed I didn't finish through everything in this last stretch. But, the good thing is that it's mostly because I've felt really good and super busy but staying balanced through all that.

,,,,I've noticed that I eat well when I have a normal sleep schedule and am not too stressed -- the biggest problem (i.e. where I screw up) is when I have a lot of work to do and I eat to maintain motivation to work. Do you have any advice on breaking out of that pattern? Thanks!,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey Anna! I think that it has something to do with the need to feel like I'm doing ""something"" when I'm studying. I get restless and sometimes experience a lack of motivation when it comes to work, and I sometimes use food to make myself happy (?) enough to work, since the flavors/textures of food act as a sort of pre-emptive reward. I also notice I have a tendency to either overeat around 2-3 pm-ish (perhaps due to being tired?) or after 11 pm (if I'm staying up late to do work). Also, I think I have tendency to use food as a treat/reward when I'm bored? I recreationally browse Yelp looking at restaurants and pictures of food, which might not be too healthy....",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Will do! Any advice on avoiding overeating in social situations? I just went to a really nice restaurant with some friends and family and definitely ate beyond the point of fullness--partly because everyone else was eating a fair amount, but also how do you avoid overeating really delicious food?

I am a little antsy and frustrated about not being able to run now, since that was my primary form of exercise...",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

I don't know how I feel about my weight staying the same. I guess it's good that it's the same, but I am still trying to lose 5-10 pounds.

I really appreciate it. 1) YES this cycle sounds exactly like it had been for those past four days 2) I had been eating regularly in terms of time. 3) Yesterday I woke up and felt COMPLETELY different, that insatiable hunger was gone. I'm not sure if it was stress or hormones or what, but it was a noticeable difference. Yesterday I didn't try to predetermine what I ate. I ate when I was hungry and that felt good.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

I've tried to connect this with my emotions: stressed, lonely, overwhelmed, but at times I also do just feel hungry. I tried to plan for eating more food, but it just has been getting out of control. I'm having a hard time figuring out how to be ""in control"" but not TOO ""in control"" to the point where it's not healthy.

,,,,"The discussion made me feel a lot of things. When she said that most diets fail, I felt helpless. When she said that our ""base point"" of how much our body thinks we should weigh, it can go up but it rarely goes down - that also made me feel really helpless. This made me feel like my body (due to its outdated perhaps instincts) is out to make me gain weight. And THEN she said that we should trust our body to know when to eat and when not to eat. This doesn't make intuitive sense to me, since she just told me that my body wants to regain weight!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

I have been getting the email notifications, but I've just been so busy (I was out of the country through October and it's been catch-up ever since). In fact, I'm feeling really on top of my eating. I'm eating foods that I know are good for me. I recently started lowering the amount of sugar (added and artificial) and that has made me a lot less anxious. I also joined the triathlon team at my school, so I have plenty of motivation to stay active and eat food that will help me succeed.

I tend to expend a lot of energy ignoring or mentally hating someone that I dislike by an forced to be around (such as a coworker or obnoxious classmate) and I've noticed that because it takes so much of my energy I tend to feel the results later in the day and it affects my eating. It affects my eating because my eating habits are closely tied to my emotions. I've used the see/hear/feel countdown from 5-1 item skill for this type of situation and I realize it brings me back to simply being. I see the bigger picture and I tend to gain control of my emotions again.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

For example, going to chipotle and order a salad but with all the same ingredients and toppings. So yes, I'm losing the calories from not getting a burrito or rice but still getting the cheese & sour cream isn't that healthy. It hasn't changed where we go to eat at all.

,,,,"Hi Alina, as I meditated over my eating problems, I realized how it arose in the first place. Coming upon college, meal times were stressful because I am more of an introvert and meeting and eating with new people in a completely new environment was very stressful. During every meal, I was forced to interact with other people and in order to avoid the nervousness and awkward silence, I just kept eating... Such reaction was coupled with my negative body image and stress from heavy academic work load, resulting in my binge-eating disorder.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Now I am way more used to meeting and talking to new people. I still prefer eating alone or with a really close friend, but when I do have to eat with others, I try to focus on the conversations more which actually made the interaction more interesting and prevent myself from being obsessive with food.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey Alina, I was super stressed out the past two days because of a really hard assignment at school and so I binged at night...

My obsession with academic and career success has pushed me to my limits, and in terms of coping with it, I think I developed the abnormal chain thoughts.

,,,,"Hi Alina, sometimes I think that my eating disorder is a symptom, not something caused by lack of will power. And sometimes I've tried to replace the behavior stage (that's between trigger and reward stage) with healthier things like exercising, listening to music, and talking to friends. Those work when I am under moderate stress, but whenever I am extremely stressed out and feel completely lost, I still go insane. And that gave me an alert about the fundamental problems in my life. I think I need to reconsider my decisions and don't put myself into situations where I would get unedurable stress. I will need to find the meaning of happiness again.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Alina,
So sorry I haven't been on in awhile. I had a week long camp with no wifi and then I was just really bad about getting back on track once I got back. I think this past week has been rough for me in terms of self esteem. I've been eating really well and exercising, but I've also been super unsatisfied with myself as a person. I feel very alone and unmotivated, like I have no purpose. These feelings haven't really affected my eating, I haven't binged or thrown up, but they are affecting my perception of my self in a really negative way.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"To answer your question from awhile ago about body image and athleticism, I do feel like they are connected, but separate in terms of performance. I think when it comes down to it, athleticism is defined by how an athlete performs on the field or in the weight room, regardless of how they look. However, I think my mind tries to link athleticism with looking perfect, i.e. 0% body fat and super toned muscles. Whenever I work out, I always have that image in the back of my mind and I tell myself that someday I'll get there, but realistically, I don't think I will.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think the triggers that make me feel worse about my body are mainly on social media. When I see pictures of people that look perfect in bikinis I get self conscious, but I also feel inadequate about my body when I'm with my teammates. I can always avoid social media to keep myself from comparing, but I can't avoid changing and showering with my teammates. The times when I have felt most confident about my body have been when I've been dating or in a relationship, but I shouldn't have to rely on a guy to feel good about myself and I don't know how to do that.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I liked the section about cultural ideals and the media. I thought it was interesting how even a beauty icon like Marilyn Monroe wouldn't measure up to the standards society has set today. The comment about how women with big thighs and butts are now being accepted as beautiful if they have skinny waists stood out to me too because that is majority of field hockey players bodies, and I always feel like I come up short on the skinny waist part.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think I'll try the ""dear body"" exercise again when I start comparing myself to others, thanks for reminding me about it! The mirror mirror exercise was interesting because I found that I wasn't super unhappy with a lot of aspects of myself, but then I would get to the problem areas and get pretty negative. I don't have issues with looking at myself in the mirror, I think my problem is that I look at myself too much and just end up focusing on the parts that I don't like. With that said, I think the mirror mirror exercise was good for me because I was seeing parts of myself that I usually overlook.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Even though I was able to notice positive things about myself, I think the negative things kept me from feeling good about myself after the exercise. I don't know if that was necessarily the objective, but I think I'd like to be able to do that exercise and walk away feeling confident and more accepting than I did this past time.
On another note, I saw a documentary ""Forks Over Knives"" the other day and it is making me consider doing a whole foods plant based diet. I've been researching it a little bit since the movie and I've found some really good recipes on their website that I want to try.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think my biggest concern is that starting this diet will be bad for some reason. I didn't consider calorie counting to be unhealthy for a long time, so I don't want to make a similar mistake in trying this out. Basically I don't want to give into something that will only complicate my eating issues, so I would really like your opinion on this before I decide whether or not to go for it!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My motivation behind this new diet is just to be healthier. The documentary that inspired me to try it had a lot of concrete evidence that meat and dairy products are extremely detrimental to humans. The Western diet puts too much emphasis on protein and we over consume it because we don't realize that protein is present in a variety of natural foods. Overconsumption of protein results in a lot of health risks, and I think something that stood out to me was how people who switched to whole-food plant based diets could overcome diseases like diabetes and cancer.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Being a college student, I know I will have to be flexible with this diet because I'm not always going to have the time or the resources available to only eat unprocessed, whole foods. However, I do think that I can cut out meat and make a commitment to seeking out foods that are permitted in the diet whenever possible. I think that because I actually find the food appealing, and because I have reasons for trying it that are unrelated to my body image, this will be a positive experience for me.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think this diet appeals to me mainly because I have never really liked meat that much anyway, and I don't need to worry about over eating or calorie counting because people generally eat more food on this diet. I was concerned about how it would work with being a college athlete, but the diet actually gives people more energy, helps with recovery, and doesn't detract from athletic performance at all which is super encouraging.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you! I feel like this is going to be good for me. With this new diet there are a lot of forbidden foods that I can't avoid altogether, and I did have the opportunity to work with that the other day. I got up very early and hiked a couple of mountains with a friend of mine and afterwards we went for breakfast and there wasn't anything on the menu that was permitted with this new diet, but I understood that I needed some kind of nourishment and so I ended up getting eggs, hash browns, and pancakes. It was good for me because I realized it wasn't the end of the world, and I didn't fel bad afterwards.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks Alina! Being able to be flexible made me feel like I was in more control and it didn't cause me anxiety which was really nice. I think if I can remember the positive things my body does for me and make myself realize that everyone is created differently I will feel less self conscious about myself. Maybe if I could remember the parts of myself that I like in those moments, that might also be helpful.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Sarah, nice to meet you! I am really trying to focus on being happy with who I am, and keeping perspective in addition to being flexible have certainly been helpful. I still have issues with comparing myself to others, but I'm beginning to feel more comfortable with myself which is a positive takeaway. The past couple days have been alright. I haven't had problems with eating, and I've been pretty distracted with activities which is a nice change. I think when I am being social I tend to forget about my insecurities because I feel accepted.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"So far I've tried the counting and sit grounding exercises and I've liked them both. I think the counting one will be easy for me to do anywhere, so I really like that about it.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think eating healthy will benefit me in the long run. If I start the habits now, it will be easier to keep up later in life. I also like to think that eating better will enhance my athletic performance.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Maybe if I can distract myself by talking to someone, that might help me. That would help me in a lot of situations but probably not when I'm alone or not with someone I know. I think I could try the grounding exercise because I think that does a good job of calming me down, but I don't know if it will keep me from being negative. Worth a shot though!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I play field hockey, and yes performing well is definitely important to me! I think since I have started this program I have been better about checking in with my feelings. There was something in the beginning of the program that talked about allowing yourself to be in an emotional state and not trying to fight it. I think since that tip I've had a better awareness and acceptance of how I'm feeling without needing to binge or throw up.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think the more I learn about how my body and metabolism work, the more I want to keep myself on schedule which has made eating regularly encouraging and less stressful than it was before all of this. I think it's also helped being at home to reset everything.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I actually just talked to my mom about the bingeing and throwing up and I'm pretty sure it was a control thing. When I got to college my confidence went way down. If I was feeling super inadequate I would just throw up after any meal, even if I didn't over eat. The bingeing usually happened when I'd given up on trying to control my weight, but then I'd feel guilty about it and throw up anyway. I think a lack of confidence in myself is what led to the vomiting, and it wasn't just a lack of confidence in my appearance, but also in my athletic abilities. So in addition to the vomiting I would do extra running to feel better about myself.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yay, I'm glad you're back! I hope you had a nice break! Yeah I definitely think the opposite action tool is easier said than done, but I hadn't thought of using my body language to really convince myself of confidence. I will definitely give it a try, and I know I'll be able to use it a lot throughout field hockey practices. Also, just to update you, I have officially taken all social media (Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat) off of my phone to help me stop comparing myself to other people. I've gone without it for a week and I'm really happy that I did it because I'm not constantly thinking about how I measure up to others. Kind of a nice change!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"You're absolutely right, I need to be able to handle my comparing when I'm confronted with it in person. I think trying to distract myself will be hard because it was with the elephant demonstration, so I think the best thing for me to do is to not let myself get frustrated about how I'm feeling but to just kind of accept it and move on. I don't know if I'll always be able to start meditating in these situations, but maybe if something continues to bother me, I can use it at a later time.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes I have been feeling more positive about my body image in the past month! I think some of it has to do with the fact that I have lost weight, but I think if I was at this weight at this time last year, I wouldn't have been happy or satisfied. I don't really know how to explain it because I know that the weight loss is contributing to my positivity, but I like to think that my decision making and commitment to a healthy diet are also contributing. I think I feel more at peace with myself because I feel like I'm in more control and I can understand when I'm being irrational and unfair to myself.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Having my mom to talk to has been huge. Having this program to keep me focused and snap me back to reality has been equally helpful. I think without it, I would be less inclined to think rationally when things get hard, or when I get really negative.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"I mostly feel out of control during dinner. At breakfast my stomach usually won't let me eat a lot because of practice being so soon after and my lunches are usually moderate in anticipation of the second practice. Dinner is buffet style and my plate is completely full with huge portions of food, but afterwards I don't feel satisfied. If I don't consume enough I will feel weak and tired, but when I keep eating I feel like I'm letting myself go. When I binged the other day, it took so much will power to keep me from throwing up, and then I just felt awful about myself.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"The body scan was great! It really helped me refocus before my second practice yesterday, so I think I'm going to use it more often! In other news, I'm concerned about myself. This past week I moved back out to Stanford and started preseason. First, I am receiving criticism from my teammates for going vegetarian so I'm afraid to tell my coach and it's kind of stressful. Second, I know I am working out and burning a lot of calories right now, but I can't help but think I'm allowing myself to binge. Today I think I binged twice, but I don't know how to stop myself from justifying it with the intensity of our workouts. I just don't want to get out of control again.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Mirror mirror still makes me feel a little uncomfortable, especially now that I'm back with my team and can easily compare myself to everyone anytime.
I think I've convinced myself that my body has already changed and grown since I came back just last week. But logically this doesn't make sense, so I think it's all in my head.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks for the encouragement and support Alina. I'm glad I don't have to try to deal with this alone! The self compassion segment gave me good perspective. I think the comparison of how I would treat a child versus how I treat myself makes doing the right thing for myself really obvious. I think I'll use the ""pausing"" technique to keep myself from overeating and maintain some control during meals.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I think it probably came at a good time because meat was starting to feel more like a restricted food than how I felt after immediately watching the documentary.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks Alina! I liked the Cognitive reframing because it was very logical and straightforward. I can be very emotional, but usually when I'm presented with facts I am hesitant to argue, so reframing my mindset with that technique will be very effective!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Alina,
I think grounding could be really useful when I start to have logical errors. It seems to snap me back into reality and stop me from over thinking, kind of like a reset button.
Also, I am really proud of myself because today I ate some chicken for the first time since starting this new vegetarian thing. I did't eat it intentionally, it was just in something I ordered for lunch, but I didn't feel guilty eating it. I think I was really nervous about eating meat again because I'd gone so long without having it, and I thought I'd be disappointed in myself if I ate it, but I was actually just really relieved.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I think cognitive reframing is harder with body image because it's such an objective thing. Finding evidence against my automatic thoughts is difficult when it concerns how I think I look. Do you have any tips? Or could you give me an example of how this could be used with body image?,,,,,none,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I like the cognitive reframing exercise! I have used it a couple of times in the past couple of days. It's easiest when I find I'm trying to interpret what people are thinking about me, and then I convince myself that they probably aren't thinking about me at all, and I feel better. I haven't tried it yet with my body image, but I think I'll make a more conscious effort to do it from now on.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Alina, sorry I've been a bit MIA, and thank you for the heads up on everything. To go back to the cognitive reframing, I think I understand what you're saying about shifting the focus from my body. I've been using that technique for other parts of my life, but I could easily use it for body image as well. As for the outside help, I'm meeting with our team nutritionist to keep me on track with eating and healthiness, but if I find that I need more help I'll reach out to CAPS. Thank you so much for helping me, I really have appreciated your encouragement and advice!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Alina,
Thanks for the reminder! Meeting with the nutritionist has been really helpful, especially because she understands how much I need to be eating, and what foods are going to help enhance my performance. She has also encouraged me not to focus on weight at all during the season, which has been kind of a relief for me. I think it will be good having her to keep me on track and focused on eating in a more positive way. I'm really looking forward to it!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Alina,
thanks again for the reminder! I restricted my eating because we had a travel day, and I felt like the food I was eating at the airport was pretty gross, so I didn't want to eat too much of it. I wouldn't say that I was starving myself, but I restricted myself from eating my whole lunch because it was nasty and I didn't feel great about eating it.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I felt that restriction was better for me in that instance, but I don't know if that was wrong. I think I was thinking that the food reward thing would be more like eating dessert? I also don't know if I need a reward, but that was what I came up with.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yeah that makes sense and sounds like a good plan. I can't really remember my thoughts on that section, but I think I remember it saying that setbacks happen and it's normal so to not get discouraged but just get back to good habits sooner. I feel like I'll be prepared if/when those situations happen to me.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Alina, Sorry I've been MIA, this quarter is really crazy for me and I feel like I don't have time to log onto Lantern, which is stupid because it takes a total of 15 minutes. I think I'm just lacking motivation to use the program right now. My eating has been alright, I had to ease myself off of being a vegetarian because it was unfortunately affecting my athletic performance. I hope to go back to being a vegetarian after my senior season. Since I've come back to eating meat, I think I'm not doing as good a job with eating well which is irritating me.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"For the most part, I don't think about how I look anymore which is good because I have too many other things to think about in my life, but it seems that when I am thinking about myself and how I look it's not necessarily positive.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm making my own food which has helped me with consistency and portions but I keep going for convenience because I have limited time that I can spend preparing food. I have been able to keep myself from throwing up which I'm proud of, but I still can't escape the negative thoughts I have about myself. I can't tell if they are happening less than before, but I still freak out and hate my body if I see a bad picture of myself. The body comparing between myself and my teammates is still happening, and I think it's almost an unconscious thing that happens overtime I'm with them. I think the difference is that now I'm not trying to change myself?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I have actually been doing body scans pretty consistently. I've used them to relax and feel good before games a lot this season and I think they're really helping.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks for understanding! I think I'm worse with eating because I'm eating more sweets and processed foods that aren't good for me. It's harder for me to say no to cookies and chocolate than it was when I was trying to be a vegetarian, and I'm not sure why or if that's even correlated at all.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm focusing a lot on school and field hockey at the moment and when I'm not focusing on that, I'm focusing my energy on my relationships with my roommates and teammates. When I think about my body image it's hard for me to be positive because I think I'm gaining weight but it's hard for me to tell because I won't let myself get on a scale so that I won't freak out. Sometimes I think my clothes are fitting me tighter and that makes me nervous, or I'll see a picture of myself in an unflattering angle and get really self-conscious about it.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you for that perspective, I hadn't thought about the flexibility that way and that makes me feel better about where I'm at. I will try not to constantly assess myself and how I look for this next week and see if it helps me at all with my morale.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I think the cognitive reframing exercise is good for me when I'm in the right mind set for it. There are some times when I just don't want to think rationally about how I'm feeling and I don't know why. In those moments I think I know I'm being irrational or over exaggerating something but I don't want to reframe my thought.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My roommates have been really great about talking to me and being there for me when I am in negative introspective moods and they encourage me and remind me constantly to love myself and love my body for the things it does for me.

,,,,"Hi Alina! I apologize for being MIA again. Thanksgiving was great, and finals week has been stressful but I'm making sure that I'm putting my body and mental health first despite the hard schedule.

,,,,Fourth of July is always quite different for me from year to year. For as long as I can remember I have always eaten a lot on the fourth but I want to stay in control of my eating and eat a normal amount as if it were a typical day. I remember last fourth feeling particularly upset with myself because I went into a very extreme binge and attempted to purge my body with laxatives. It was not a very fun day. Tomorrow I want to have fun. I want to feel good about myself. I think I want to definitely have a hamburger.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,There will also be s'mores. I am worried about having these because last time I did eat them I went and binged afterwards. But I feel worried that I will feel pressured to have one when the time comes and that worries me. My goal for tomorrow is to just stay in control.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Fourth of July went well! I stuck to my plan and had a great time. And I am not sure if I necessarily feel rejected but sometimes I definitely feel lonely.

I know these are very normal feelings but it just sucks that i lose control of my eating habits when they come around. Thanks for checking in",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,thanks Elise sorry I have been sort of absent from the program over the last few weeks. I have been doing some traveling around Europe and getting Internet has been tough. Eating has also been really tough. I have been trying hard to avoid binging but I feel like it always catches up to me. I have been on the beach recently and being in a bikini makes me uncomfortable. I don't know why I am still not comfortable with my body and I wish I was. Thanks for reaching out.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,I am traveling with a friend of mine who is quite thin and looks unbelievable in a bikini. No matter how she bends or sits or turns she still has a flat stomach. I know this is not typical among women but I still often feel awkward sitting next to her knowing that my stomach is much larger and not as skinny as hers. I find that I am having a hard time with food in the evenings. After dinner I have this fixation that I need more food when in fact I know I don't. I even went to the grocery store,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I had a great week a dam looking forward to the weekend as I move back today!,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,One other goal or thing I'd like to work on is not thinking about food so often.

,,,,I realized I look at my body a lot in reflective surfaces just everyday as I am walking around. In. Haines windows and other mirrors around the city. I had no idea it could be so damaging to my body image. It also stood out to me that the small patch of skin on my stomach could give me so many positive and/or negative thoughts depending on the day and how it looks. Something that small and insignificant shouldn't have such a great affect on how I feel.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

Thank you for asking. Surprisingly, things went pretty well as far as eating and body image issues while traveling.

,,,,"Nitya, those are all great questions, and I'm challenged to find answers to them. I think that part of my work will be to make healthier choices in these high stress situations. In the past I have prioritized my workout/eating routine and my work (school, etc.) Over things like spending time with friends. I have, for the most part been able to keep up on these two things, but the problem has been that after a while, I breakdown and am crippled by the stress. This obviously isn't healthy, but unfortunately this cycle has repeated itself often in the last few years. As you said, I think that spending time is an important thing as well, and could be the reason for these breakdowns.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hey Nitya, I have one quick question for you. It may sound trivial, but I was wondering about the Meal Planner technique. I don't find it particularly useful, (and truthfully the email reminders are a bit annoying) since I rarely know when and where Im going to eat the next day. I was hoping you might be able to tell me about its role in the program, or if theres any way I can move through the program without it in the future. Thanks, Jack.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Nitya, thanks for getting back to me. I typically plan to have three meals a day, along with two snacks in between. Of course, given my schedule, the timing of these meals/snacks varies. I do recognize the importance of planning, however, as eating regularly and being conscious of when and how much I eat prevents binging and other unhealthy behaviors. Im just curious if theres a way to bypass the email alerts, or the planner altogether so that I can move forward with the other techniques that I have otherwise found very effective.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Nitya, this weekend was also difficult in terms of being mindful about my food intake. I struggled with bingeing and found myself thinking more and more often about my body and how much I had eaten. Ive found myself turning towards food as a way of dealing with the stress Ive been under and Im nervous about the temporary level of comfort it gives me to binge. I agree with you, the meal planner will surely be a useful tool. Its just that the last thing I want to do is go back and track what I've eaten today - I feel ashamed and discouraged about my progress.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"The weekend was alright, I didnt have many issues regarding body image, or eating habits, which I was surprised by based on the tougher week I had leading up to it. I'm encouraged by that, but clearly I have a ways to go. Usually after a bad binge or a period of unhealthy habits I am back to square one - feeling pretty awful about myself and having a much harder time restoring some of the healthy ways of looking at eating. Fortunately, that has not been the case this weekend as much as it has been in the past.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I agree completely with what you said about the meal planning. Its interesting to look at it as a tool rather than a regiment to compare my actual eating habits against to see how far I am from actually being healthy. Changing this outlook will help me embrace it as more of a building block in the process rather than a reflection on my guilt. Thank you for your continued support Nitya, I really do appreciate your kind words.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Nitya, thank you for the kind words. I think the fact that my recovery from the unhelathy behaviors last week is definitely a result of the work I've taken part in thus far. Its always reassuring to see these methods paying off in real life. Of course, the next step is to take preventative action against those behaviors, but Im encouraged by the fact that things are working better so far. Hope you enjoyed your weekend as well, Jack.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Nitya, I appreciate you monitoring my progress so diligently. Its true that Ive struggled with binges recently, and the numbers Ive reported have been higher than usual. What I mean when I record a binge is that Ive had an incident where I eat an amount far in excess of what I know is the required intake for me to be full and healthy. In a binge I eat until I am either physically uncomfortable or there simply isnt anymore appealing food readily available. I think its interesting to note that I rarely seek out binges, instead my binges occur when there is food immediately available and I cannot stop thinking about the fact that it is in the fridge/pantry/whatever. For example, I often avoid grocery shopping or shop in small increments in order to avoid having too much food on hand in fear of that triggering a binge.
These binges often contain a caloric intake equal to two-three of my regular meals and therefore I often restrict the next meal or just avoid it altogether ie. bingeing at lunch and not eating until the next morning.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi! Thanks for the link to the forum I'm excited to check it out! And on the topic of self-compassion, I think the blocking belief that self-criticism is an effective motivator really resonated with me. I'm usually pretty harsh on myself because I have really high expectations of myself which can feed into negative cycles of thoughts and behaviors sometimes.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,And my week's been alright. I had a rough day yesterday and called my best friend from home and told her about my struggle with binging and purging. She was the first person I've ever told about that and she was really supportive so I think that was a major step for me,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"thanks! This week's lessons have been pretty helpful at making me realize patterns of thoughts that I didn't even notice I had. I'd say the situation with my roommate is definitely an example of mind reading, and I think I jump to conclusions like that too easily in other contexts as well.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi! I'm not really sure what led to the increase in binging- maybe stress? I've been trying really hard to get back to the basics and get into a more regular eating pattern which hopefully will help with the binging. I'm also trying to really avoid purging even if I have binged.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,One thing that's been hard for me lately is that I'm very self-conscious about my eating habits around my roommate. I think she has noticed that something is a little off and I saw that she had a group chat with some other girls who I thought were my friends and they were all like making fun of how much I eat sometimes which was really really hurtful to see.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,Thank you! I've been trying to give myself a little more space from my roommate than before by spending more time studying in the library instead of my room and eating and spending time with some of my other friends which has really helped improve my mood.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi! Sorry that I've missed your messages the past few days; I was home visiting family! I feel like I've grown a lot in these past few months. I have a greater understanding of my own patterns of thoughts and behaviors as well as my personal triggers. One thing that's still concerning me is that I still do binge/purge somewhat frequently.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Thanks! The situation with my roommate hasn't really changed; we're very friendly and I decided to just let it go because everyone talks badly about others at some point and she probably didn't realize how sensitive I am about that issue.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Thank you, and that sounds great! I think that I've grown a lot throughout this program. I have a better understanding of my own habits, as well as how my thoughts, feelings, and assumptions play into my behavior patterns. I think that I'm more able to recognize negative patterns of thinking and behaving and I have a better understanding of how important my health is to my everyday wellbeing and happiness.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also, my mindful eating practice has been going well! I have a lot of good reasons for wanting to pick up this habit, so I have a lot of motivation. The only problem that I am having is remembering to think mindfully about my food choices- sometimes I automatically eat food, especially if it is right in front of me, even if I am not hungry or even if I don't particularly want it.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi! I'm doing well! Things have been really busy lately with the end of the semester and Thanksgiving but I'm hoping to get back on track with the program now!,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi! I think a lot of challenges I will face in the upcoming few weeks will involve school stress, but hopefully I can mediate that by planning ahead and taking care of myself by getting enough sleep, exercise, and healthy eating. One thing I would really like to work on is being less sensitive to the thoughts of what others around me may be thinking (or what I think they're thinking), and putting less pressure on myself to achieve ""perfection"" in various aspects of my life.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi! I've been doing well. I actually went on an antidepressant before I came back to school, and it's really improved my mood and also has seriously lowered my urges to binge/purge. I'm hoping that this semester will be smoother because of it! I've a little worried about stress due to classes, and also figuring out a housing situation for next year, so hopefully I can manage that anxiety in a healthy way.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Alina, no apology is needed, I understand that life gets in the way sometimes and I am stable enough on this journey where it was fine for me to go a couple days without a response. My OA is certainly amazing and so helpful! I have a group of people who I am constantly texting and they are so supportive and just understand me.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I try coping with my financial stress through meditation and reminding myself that all college students feel this stress and I am not alone in this. Also I go home and work on the weekends some and this makes me feel better in my journey at college having some spending money.

,,,,"I have not had a chance to try any because most of my food are restaurant style and it is hard to find time to get to the restaurant and I honestly do not yet feel strong enough where I think I could eat any of these foods in moderation. Instead I had some of my boyfriends pancakes and a small piece of cake at the wedding we went to so I am not setting myself up to fail. As long as I know I can only have one piece of cake or one bite of pancakes, etc I know I can't continue to binge.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,I am working on mindfulness and trying to determine what I am feeling before reacting. I need to work on making time to meditate each day. Sometimes I get so overwhelmed with work and class and life that I don't take time to focus on me and making myself happy. I want to make such to take at least 15 min a day each day to get in touch with my feelings and just relax.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Ive been trying to get in the habit of doing it first thing in the morning and if I forget then making sure I meditate right before bed which is SUPER helpful for making me fall asleep. 
Also, OA is AMAZING. The group keeps me so strong and having this online component is really beneficial. I feel great lately and its exam week last week and this week and typically I am stressed and binging BUT I haven't been because I have all of these coping techniques. 
-Jess",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It was...interesting. I wonder if I could think of these opposite emotions on my own though, having the tool on here do it for me is nice but without someone telling me the opposite emotion I am not sure I would be able to determine it.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think mindfulness is important for me especially at night. Typically it is at night when I lose control and feel like over eating. I think if I can stop, breathe, and be mindful as to what I am really feeling I can figure out how to deal with my emotions without food
I feel as though I am almost to the point where I finally just have this moment where I can fully grip my emotions. Each day gets better and I am learning other ways to spend my time. Although I have the occasional slip up I am determinded to stop binging and learning to feel comfortable with myself. OA is so helpful along with this!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I also and trying to reteach myself how to tell when I am truly hungry and when I am full. I wait until I can prove I am hungry such as my stomach growling, feeling tired/fatigue due to needing food, lack of energy, etc then I eat a small amount, wait for a half an hr or so and see if I need more food or if I feel content. I think this will be good for me and HOPEFULLY will help me stop obsessing over tracking calories or point for Weight Watchers and just learning to eat instinctively again.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"This should also allow me to be more flexible with my eating because as long as I am eating when I am hungry and stopping when I am full I should (hopefully) be able to go out to dinner and lunch with friends without feeling stress and anxiety the entire time

,,,,"yes I do this A LOT! I avoid clothing, situations, conversations, etc that will make me feel anxiety because it is something I have always had and have trouble dealing with and learning how to manage my anxiety. I think a big part of this for me is realizing that I am human and it is okay for me to feel sad, anxious, angry, etc and I need to just learn healthy ways to cope with these feelings and emotions.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks Alina, I am going through some family issues currently which are certainly pushing me to use food as my outlet but I am trying SO HARD to deal with my feelings without food. I never allow myself to cry or feel pain, instead I cover it up by eating and I think it is finally time to allow myself to just cry and deal with my feelings once and for all!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"I used to handle setbacks SO BADLY. I would use food, when I was like 13 I would cut myself (mostly for attention), I would get ANGRY like unbelievably angry. Now when I have a set back I use the phrase that everything happens for a reason and although it may be a setback at the time it is probably preparing me or putting me on the path for something greater to come",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

Even when I plan just one slice of cake/pie/etc it never works that way.

However, with Thanksgiving coming up we celebrate at my house with our entire family and there is SO MUCH DESSERT",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It is so ironic how much of this program aligns with the 12 steps in Overeater Anonymous
I think that is what is helping me so much, identfying the REAL problems and not just grazing over the surface. today i started to over eat and felt a binge coming on and was able to leave the room and pray and meditate which is something 6 months ago i would have NEVER been able to do",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes i do find it helpful. I try to say things each day i love about myself each day and things I am grateful for that are not necessarily related to me. Like, I am grateful that people in our world experience love, etc.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Yes that makes complete sense! I binged and threw up last night for the fist time in 105 day and was/am so disappointed in myself. I am starting new today but am just very frustrated I gave all that up,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,My triggers are still my emotions and when I am alone (bored) I tend to think that I am not worth being around and that is why I am alone and I don't know what to do with my time so I turn to food for comfort. Also this happens a lot when I am over tired. Just trying to stay positive and remind myself just because I messed up one night doesn't mean I destroyed all the process I've made.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I LOVED THE THINK LIKE A BEGINNER EXERCISE!!!! This was by far my favorite! I was at home and frustrated with my mom when I did and it was SO HELPFUL! It really calmed me down and made notice smaller details in life which unintentionally made me realize where I was before was not a place of content and happiness and my frustration was that of my own, not her fault. This activity was great. I love being more aware of my surroundings!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I have exams this next week so I will be using this them by just seeing where I am and what is around me and really orienting myself to being present.

,,,,"Sorry Alina, life has been so hectic this past week with exams. However, I have used meditation and journaling a lot and made sure to take time for me to have fun so I don't complete lose touch with myself. Things have been good this week as far as my eating goes but my stress levels are high, exam weeks are HELL. I am going to use some of the meditation techniques in a bit once I am home from the library and can sit quietly and reflect.

,,,,"I am both stressed and excited about break. I am stressed because I am worried about all the food I will be around and also I get anxious knowing I will be at my parents house for over a week and I feel I will get annoyed because they always have SO MANY BINGE FOODS. However, my sister is coming to visit from CA and I could not be more excited to see her and spend time with her:) So I am going to just try to plan my meals and know what I am going to eat and what perhaps I may need to avoid. I am going to make sure to meditate and exercise to manage my anxiety and I want to remember to have fun! Holidays are about seeing our loved ones, not about the food!:)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,I find balance often when I take time and meditate. I have been trying to do some exercise or meditation every day because I feel much more balanced when I do these things.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

I know something is greater then me and can restore me to sanity. Thanks for all you do!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"When I am angry I used to lash out at other people and blame others, now I try to remember that anger like all emotions is a feeling and it will pass.

,,,,"Learning to pause is going well. I had a bad habit of watching TV while eating. As a student, I felt that the only time that I have the justification to relax is the dining time. So I tended to extend the dining time as long as possible. As the posts from Lantern said, it is never just about eating, but a reflection of some other cause. Now I try to set some certain time for study and try to have some leisure time without guilt. I also dine with friends more often. All these help me to eat more consciously and therefore feel the need to pause when necessary.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,Yes. I told my friends about my eating problem and ask them to keep an eye on me. I eat more often with friends. I also try decorating my food with some white sesame and paid attention to the color arrangement in cooking.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Mirror is a trigger. Shopping as well.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"My cousin comes to visit me for two weeks. We've been traveling around. He eats a lot and buys things that I always try to avoid, like chocolate pudding, bread, ice cream, etc. It's hard for me. I finished most of the chocolate pudding. I spread chocolate pudding over the banana covered toast for breakfast. I sincerely thank him for bringing those things back. Now I know that I can eat these food with control. The trigger is actually loneliness. As long as I keep actively hanging out with friends, I should be fine.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi, Michelle. Finally I'm back. I got lazy after the school started. So far everything is in control. I eat properly most of the time but I have to admit that I eat more than two snacks per day. I think I lack some sleep and get pressure from the study load. Again, I'm eating so as to have a justification not to study. But this time I'll adjust and get back to normal soon. Thanks for the concern and I hope to keep the habit of using lantern.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi, Michelle. Do you think it could be the influence of my PMS? I couldn't sleep well. I feel more eager to eat to energize myself sometimes.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,Yes. Most time I cannot name my emotions. I didn't realize that I was unhappy until I binged.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Planning my meals ahead of time sometimes proved difficult, especially if I'm making dinner plans with my friends and am not sure what I'm eating. I think my biggest issue is that I think, ""I deserve this!"" and then just end up eating way too much.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

Before I know it, I've consumed half a loaf of chocolate bread because it's so good. I also keep telling myself that my body will bounce back into shape because I bike a lot or work out a lot. However, if I have a massive binge session I will refuse to eat for 24 hours to fast off the calories. I usually think I deserve to eat if I had a ""healthy"" day before, meaning the right number of calories (I only estimate).",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Thanks for checking in with me! I typically work out with a friend at 6:30 in the morning, but because sometimes she works out lightly, I might do some hardcore HIIT exercises in the middle of the day or right after our workout. It's healthy for me to do it with someone, because then I know when I'm pushing myself too hard. It becomes unhealthy when the only thing I want to focus on is exercising. Like once, I was at work and had to excuse myself to go to the bathroom, and do some split jumps. I enjoy HIIT workouts and cycling the most because they're different ways of getting in cardio, but I also do like bodyweight weight training as well.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Right--I'm pretty sure that's what happening with me, so today I ate some multigrain bread with lunch, which was great. Now, I'm really trying to approach the food with a ""I can have this at any time"" mindset and not think ""Oh my gosh, I'm going to restrict myself later so I can't have any of this food!"" which is what causes all the binging.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also, recently I think the binging was caused by my desire to make myself a little bit heavier for my return home, because I didn't want my family to freak out about my weight loss. However, that definitely didn't work because they noticed how much weight I lost anyways.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"That sounds good. I'm trying to rebuild confidence in my body image. It used to be that I was really good at defending myself from comments about the other extreme side of the spectrum, that I was eating too much or getting too fat.

,,,,"Journaling has been helping me in recovering from binges. For now, I'm still in the process where I think some small meals = binging, but I'm getting better and writing everything down puts things in perspective.

Coming from an Asian family, it's really typical for my family members to say, ""Oh, you should eat more/less"" and shove food onto my plate. Telling them about my issues makes me feel vulnerable, and I don't always think they're comfortable with those conversations. I'm not sure how to reach out to older members of my family for support.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"I definitely felt the urge to scrutinize my body, and it was difficult looking away and accepting my body for what it was. I always expect my body, once it gets to a certain point/size/look, to stay the same, and when it doesn't (due to anything from binge eating to natural reasons and changes), I typically get very frustrated.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

Being restrictive is easy--it takes even more work to be flexible with myself and my eating habits.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Aww, thanks! I don't know how good this is, but I think it's because it's of my busy schedule. I'm often on the go now and don't have time to think about my eating habits as much.

,,,,"Thanks! I actually was able to look into the discussion board, but it doesn't seem too active. In terms of binging, I've found that if I eat a little bit during dinner, instead of starving myself and waiting until ""later... and then later..."" to eat, then I don't binge. Also, if I'm not bored, then I don't binge. So if I'm actively engaging with someone, then I'm focused on the conversation and not so much eating.

,,,,"Yeah, I think that at the beginning of the program, I was at the start of my binge-eating episodes, but recently it got worse due to changing environments.

Finals are coming right around the corner.

I'm definitely in such a better place now. Over Thanksgiving, it was really easy to just eat every single meal and not feel like I was hungry or full or anything, so I became way more in tune with my body. I also gained a bit of weight during that time, but I think it was enough where I realized I needed to just live a healthy lifestyle and not starve/restrict myself, and just eat very intuitively.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"I think the biggest hurdle is always trying to be polite about not eating some of the food my relatives offer. As you know, in Asian culture (as well as most cultures), eating is a sign of respect and love, so some of my relatives find it a little bit disconcerting when I turn down their food. I'm trying to find ways to deny their offerings politely, and have found the most successful way has been, ""In a little bit."" Are there other ways you can think of?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

Essentially, I've been doing better with not binge eating, but it still happens (although I think it still might be psychological, because I wrote down everything and it isn't really that much.) I'm going to schedule an appointment at Vaden in the meantime, and see how things pan out. On my end, I've started to work out by lifting, which is much better for my mind just because I don't have to associate exercise with calories or anything.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Well, I have been going to weekly counseling and I think that itself is helping quite a lot. And this website seems a bit directed around those with eating disorders, which I do not have. I actually suffer from depression/anxiety and have been diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in the past year. This issue prevents me from losing weight easily and makes it very easy to gain weight. This helped my self esteem a bit because now I know it's not really my fault that I am overweight.

Because there is no concrete evidence about them judging me. It is just because they are all younger and fitter than me, that I feel like I don't fit in there.

What's more, for my job I needed to be in the kitchen, so that didn't help anything.

,,,,"Hi Anna - Yes starting graduate school has been really difficult for me. Even though I've struggled with eating and body image issues since I started high school, my habits really took a turn for the worse after I graduated from college and moved to a new city for a job. The job didn't work out as well as I'd hoped and I was in a long distance relationship, so I turned to food to help deal with the depression and boredom. I had also used food to help me deal with the stress of my senior year and I had gained about 10 pounds. Over the past year, I found myself eating more and then exercising to compensate (2+ hours every day). At certain work or social functions, I would binge to help deal with the anxiety. The binges kept getting worse and worse, and I started taking laxatives and tried to make myself throw up to get rid of the extra food. Since I?ve started graduate school, I?m no longer in a long distance relationship but still find myself struggling to make friends and build a support structure. With the benefits from the university health center available to me, I finally decided that I needed to get help with my eating problems. It wasn?t until this point that I realized that I have been suffering from bulimia. I understand that making this realization was a very important step forward in overcoming this disorder, but I felt overwhelmed and scared by it ? which actually added to my symptoms. I feel like every meal is an obstacle and oftentimes I feel sick after eating, even if I know it was a reasonable amount. I have had a few binges but have found it a bit easier to stop myself from eating. I think now I am more aware of what is causing my behavior and am better at separating the eating from the emotions. I still find myself under incredible amounts of stress ? I was an excellent student in college and never had to struggle much to get my work done. However, as a PhD student I?m frequently struggling with all of my work and find myself feeling inadequate. Sometimes I still turn to food to deal with the stress, but I think I am also improving upon this behavior as well.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna - I've past the ""Weighing In"" portion of the program now, which asks to weigh myself once per week. I used to weigh myself multiple times per day, but stopped since I started going to treatment. I weighed myself again today and I can't help but feeling utterly disappointed. I've been trying for a year now to lose weight from my senior year of college - I gained over 15 pounds. Over the last year I managed to lose about 10 pounds, but since the summer I have gained back another 5. I feel like now I'm right back where I started, and I'm so disappointed in myself for not being able to achieve this goal. These feelings of disappointment have sometimes led me to binge. I hope that by writing to you about it I can express these feelings without just turning to food. I know I?m not supposed to be dieting but I?m really unhappy with my body right now. I feel unattractive even with my boyfriend. He really wanted me to lose the weight, and we often had arguments about it when I was unable to do lose weight. He has backed off since I started treatment but I still feel like some of the things he says are still telling me to lose weight ? like I need to ?exercise more? and ?stand up straight.? I know I would feel much better about myself if I could lose 10 lbs again but my repeated failures to do so have just made me feel worse and worse.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna ? sorry it?s been a while, so I?ll respond to your messages in order. I think that the relaxation article made some good points, as I will often reach for food when feeling stressed. The breathing exercises are very similar to what I?ve done before in yoga classes, which I found very helpful with managing stress. I had not thought to try it when under a stressful situation that might cause me to binge, so I think it would be useful for me to give this a try.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"For the self esteem exercise, I found that I generally rank my intelligence as my most important factor. Although being in grad school has been a really unusual situation for me in that I feel like I am no longer ?smart? as compared to my peers. This perception of myself really developed in high school where I did really well in school but didn?t feel like I fit in with my peers. Now, even though I have a lot in common with my peers I still don?t feel like I really belong as part of a group. I spend a lot of time with my classmates but I haven?t really made any true friends ? which I would consider someone I feel comfortable being myself around and possibly opening up to about some of the challenges I?ve been going through with school and eating habits.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Over the last few days, I?ve been to a few social events and felt like I was better able to control my eating. It wasn?t where I?d like to be yet, but I felt proud of the fact that I felt that I was improving. I was feeling pretty good this morning so I decided to weigh myself ? which was a mistake because I thought I might have lost a pound or two but had actually gained two pounds since the last time I weighed myself. This put me in a bad mood very quickly which lasted the whole day. Every Wednesday, the department has a seminar (a guest lecturer comes and gives a talk about their research), which we call ?cookie time? as there is free cookies and coffee provided. I was already feeling bad, so I just caved and ate 5 cookies before I even stopped to think about what I was doing. And of course, this only made me feel even worse about myself. It?s hard to have an improved body image when I?ve been wanted to lose weight for over a year now, my clothes aren?t fitting anymore, and now I?m only moving in the opposite direction.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"When I say bad, it means generally tired and stressed, depressed, and feeling uncomfortable with my body and feeling fat and needing to lose weight. Since I started school I?ve noticed that on some days when I?m feeling bad I also feel physically ill (nauseous/sick to my stomach). Sometimes these bad feelings about myself are so distracting that I can?t really focus on what?s going on around me ? especially in situations like class or a lecture where I?m already having trouble following or am not very interested in the topic.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Sometimes I?ve tried to induce vomiting with the gag reflex, but I?ve never been able to make myself actually vomit. Somehow, the attempt makes me feel a bit better (I guess this is still considered purging) because I feel like I?ve punished myself for bad behavior. I know that there are other methods to induce vomiting but I never wanted to try that as it seemed like too much of a health risk. I guess that?s why I started using laxatives ? because it?s a fairly commonly used medication and I did some mental gymnastics to convince myself that I needed to be taking them. Even though I know better now, it?s become a habit.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I found it hard to find anything positive about myself because my thoughts are so clouded by the negatives ? especially the overwhelming feeling that I need to lose weight.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks for the encouragement. I feel like I am now better able to enjoy social functions more rather than allowing food to cause me anxiety that leads to a binging situation. And I?m also starting to break the habit of eating out of stress, by taking a step back and telling myself that the food is not what I actually want or need at the moment. I haven?t completely broken these habits yet, but I?ve been able to improve my behavior and keep a positive attitude to keep the momentum going on making more progress. I?ve realized that the main change is in my mental attitude towards food, and not so much on having to change when and what I eat. On another positive note, I?ve found that my eating habits and weight have stabilized.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I also did the forbidden foods exercise ? I went to eat pizza last night with Jeremy. We split a small pizza and he ate slightly more than half and me slightly less than half.

I guess I couldn?t get it out of my mind that it was a ?bad food.? I also felt like if I had been on my own I would not have been able to stop myself from eating the whole thing. Pizza is definitely one of my forbidden foods that I encounter a lot as it is often the provided food at various social/volunteer events (and I don?t have the choice of choosing something else to eat) and has caused me to binge multiple times in the past.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Anna! I went to another social for my department today and I was able to enjoy visiting with others and enjoy the food without binging, so I would consider that another victory. I?m realizing now that by allowing myself to enjoy certain foods, rather than feeling guilty about eating them, overall I end up eating less (ok, I still felt somewhat guilty, but no binging). This is actually a pretty important for me because I was in a very vulnerable state today ? I got back my first exam score today and was pretty disappointed in my grade (though unsurprised). It really caused me to get upset and frustrated about my performance so far in school and how much I?ve been struggling with the work. I stayed up late last night working on homework and hadn?t gotten much sleep. Sometimes I feel like I?m just pounding my head into the desk for hours, and I know that my classmates are also afraid to ask for help.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Many of my extended family members are overweight or obese, and my dad has been on/off diets since I was a kid. Sometimes people would make jokes about how ?getting fat? was basically inevitable as a part of the family. This has probably contributed to my desires to strictly control my weight and caused me to constantly think of myself as being too fat. My younger sister has also expressed a lot of the same sentiments. About a year and a half ago, when I weighed about 15 lbs less than I do now, I would get a lot of comments from family about how I seemed ?too thin.? These comments were really hurtful to me as it seemed like no matter what I was being judged for the way I looked, especially when I actually felt the best about my body. I also thought that these comments weren?t being made out of concern, but out of resentment. Of course, I realize that being thin shouldn?t equate to how good I feel about my body, but I guess I?ve always used the number on the scale as a metric for myself.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I had another meeting with a therapist today and she said that she thinks that my desire to lose weight is the ?ED? talking, that I don?t need to lose weight, and that my weight will go where it naturally should be as I establish more regular eating habits and a better relationship with food. I definitely agree that having a healthy relationship with food is the most important goal for me right now. Because I?ve had body image and self esteem issues since I was a teenager, I?ve had a ?love/hate? relationship with food for most of my life. I have also envied others who seem so in control of their eating habits, avoid temptations and control their weight with ease. Once I?ve established this healthy relationship, if I still want to lose a few pounds, then I think I would be able to do so successfully and in a healthy manner. I certainly don?t feel ready for that yet, and I?m trying to feel better about how I look right now. I?ve noticed that I feel better about my body when I?m in a good mood, done something for fun, or gotten some exercise and feel worse when I?m feeling tired, stressed, or sad.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I used the ?prevention? technique for this scenario ? which was to pick someone to talk to when I arrived at the event, rather than hanging out by the food or on the side. I also talked to some of my other classmates who also struggled with the exam. That made me feel better that I was not alone in my sentiments. However, I usually set standards for myself that are much higher than what I would for a friend, classmate or family member. I know that I need to adjust my expectations and be less hard on myself, but it?s hard not to take it personally when I get a bad score. I?ve relied on my academic performance to boost my self-esteem for a long time, and now it seems like I?m now on the bottom in terms of school and I don?t really have anything else to rely on. It also upset me that my boyfriend did better than me on the exam but was still unhappy with his score.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I realized that this week was the first since starting the program that I hadn?t used any laxatives at all. I think this goes to show that with all of the encouragement and positive reinforcement I?ve continued to make progress. I didn?t really even think to use laxatives even though there have still been some days that I?ve been feeling down or feeling ?fat.? I think that I?ve been doing a better job of handling my school situation ? especially the stress ? but there? still a lot of self-doubt, something I haven?t really ever dealt with before. I?m still finding it hard to motivate myself to exercise, so I will continue to work on this goal as well. Also ? next week I?ll be attending a support group they have here for women in graduate school, so perhaps I can let you how that experience goes.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I thought that the pink elephant was an interesting example. I?m not really the sort of person who has difficulty expressing emotions, rather I tend to ?wear them on my sleeve.? Sometimes I do think it would be easier if I just shut out of the bad feelings regarding anxiety, self-doubt and loneliness?¦ but usually I reach out to my family or a close friend. I would say that I do think I experience these too often (at this point it?s pretty much a constant state) and that I?d rather not be feeling that way. And right now I feel like I haven?t had the mind to stop and think because I?m so stressed out. Even though I feel like my eating hasn?t been as bad as it was when I first started the program, I think I?ve experienced some backtracking.

,,,,"On Thursday one of my professors had a party for the TA?s to grade freshmen midterms. It was actually a fun time but I definitely ate much more food than I wanted, especially some cookies that she had homemade. It started when I took one?¦ and then I thought, ?well what?s the harm in eating one more?? And I ended up eating 8 cookies total, and when I got home I was exhausted and feeling sick from too much sugar. I considered taking laxatives but decided not to, but I still felt ashamed of what I had done. This week I also found myself returning to old bad habits like sneaking around the kitchen looking for something to eat even though I?m not hungry.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"This week I feel like I?ve done a bit of backpedaling with regards to eating since school has gotten more stressful with homework, studying, teaching and fellowship applications. It?s all incredibly overwhelming ? on Tuesday I had an emotional breakdown and started crying walking out of class. A woman came up to me and tried to console me, which was a nice gesture. But her advice was that I should drop one of my classes, which I don?t really consider to be an option. I can?t keep up with the workload in order to properly learn the material, so I find myself struggling for hours on homework only to give up, sometimes resorting to copying answers from others.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna ? I do find that when I?m feeling upset about school (or feeling depressed or lonely) that it is more difficult to work on body image and eating symptoms. Because I feel like I?m not really in control of how well I perform in school, that feeling gets translated to my eating habits. Often I find myself thinking ?what?s the point of trying? I?m going to fail anyway? regarding both school issues and eating. I did find the women?s support group fairly helpful ? this week the conversation dealt primarily with relationships/dating and societal expectations regarding women and family life. It was a great atmosphere for me to be able to discuss a lot of concerns that have been on my mind regarding graduate school. The relationship issues were good to talk about because I feel like I can?t be that honest with either my boyfriend or my parents regarding those topics. I?d like to go back but I?m concerned about time because I need to be studying for my exams this week. I haven?t made up my mind if I should go this week or not.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Anna ? I definitely agree that not allowing the ?slips? to turn into ?slides? has been a really important part of this process. I had another midterm today but did not stress out over it as much as I did the first one because I had a better idea of what to expect and had adjusted my expectations. However, after I got done with the exam my first thought was to get food, which really was just a way for me to try to comfort myself. It started off fine at lunch, but I felt guilty about it which lead to a ?mini-binge? later in the day (mainly feeling out of control and eating out of guilt, but not eating as much as I would have previously). Often times when I would binge I would tell myself ?I messed up today but I will be good tomorrow,? but that typically resulted in binging for multiple days in a row. I think the main goal for me to focus on is eating more consistently and listening to what my body needs. Although I realize that I still really struggle with emotional eating, even though I?ve made some progress, there?s still quite a way for me to go.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also, I did decide to go to the support group yesterday and that was more important to me than studying during that hour. It was good because I got to talk about what I?ve been going through with classes, teaching, grant writing, and being in grad school with my boyfriend and how that?s put strain on our relationship. Unfortunately, I?ve only been able to go to therapy about once every two weeks because of my busy schedule and multiple conflicts that have arisen. I think that mindfulness would be a good thing for me to incorporate into my daily life. Like I?ve said before, I have found yoga to be super helpful in the past, but I?ve found it hard to motivate myself to go recently (I?ve also been struggling to motivate myself to exercise, even though I know it makes me feel better). If you have any suggestions on how to easily incorporate it into a routine that would be helpful. It?s just not something I will remember to do unless I make it a habit. It?s really hard to detach myself from judgment, especially regarding myself. If you?ve ever heard of the Myers-Briggs personality test, my personality type is INTJ. J is for judging and I scored most strongly in that category compared to all the others. Also a note on the ?tracking? exercises that are part of the program ? I haven?t felt that they have been that useful, but I feel like my emotions or body image don?t really change much. Either I feel neutral because I?m being distracted by something else or I feel bad about myself.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna ? it?s been a while since my last reply and unfortunately I fell out the habit of checking in with the program daily. I?ve have another rough round of exams and my last midterm is this Friday. I?m hoping that once I get through this week then things will lighten up a bit, but I know that finals and then prelims are right around the corner. The stress of school and exams have been getting to me. Although I feel like I had made some progress for several weeks, I have been turning to food out of stress. I haven?t been taking laxatives but I sometimes try to restrict my food intake and feel guilty after eating a meal. This week I felt so stressed that it was making me feel physically ill to my stomach.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"In terms of the mirror-mirror exercise, I feel like it has varied. Sometimes I look and myself and think ?oh I don?t look that bad? and other times I think I look horrible. But I never really have positive thoughts about my body and that hasn?t really changed since I started. I would say that I have a lot of automatic thoughts but it?s hard to get those thoughts out of my mind, especially with my boyfriend. We both want to be in better shape and are going through a hard time in school. Honestly all of my coursework and assignments just make me feel dumber and dumber as the tasks seem more and more unsurmountable.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"After starting the program I thought I was getting better and he?s been a lot more encouraging, but now I feel out of control again. I?m pretty sure I?ve gained weight and it makes me feel super uncomfortable, and the more I think about it the more I end up eating ? it?s a self-reinforcing cycle. Even though I?ve expressed all of these concerns to him, things never change and somehow it all ends up being my fault. As much as relationships are about compromise I feel like things are a bit one-sided. Recently I thought that maybe I would be better off just ending it, but I really want to make things to work better between us. My therapist also talked about ?setting boundaries? but I?ve never considered doing anything like that before. I don?t know how I would go about doing it and I?m sure that it would not be received very well. She also suggested couples counseling but I don?t think he?d be willing to do that either.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"In terms of being in graduate school and the effect on my relationship with my boyfriend ? it?s been really tough for the both of us. While I?m struggling with self-esteem and ED issues, he struggles with ADHD and we?re both going through feeling really depressed. We?ve both been scoring consistently at the bottom of all of our classes. Jeremy made the lowest score in the class on one of the exams. It?s been so hard to stay motivated when all of our hard work and studying doesn?t show in our performance on exams. It?s very disheartening. Jeremy is seriously considering dropping out of the program, but doesn?t have an idea of what else to do. He could get a job in the area, but the point of going to grad school was because he didn?t like working a desk job and wanted to do research instead. I find myself worrying about him a lot. I do my best to try to help him with homework and studying for exams, but because I?m struggling with the material a lot too, I don?t feel like I can give him the help that he needs. In undergraduate we were always able to work together and succeed, but now I feel like I am failing myself and him too. Even though he?s told me that it?s not my responsibility to make sure he does well in school, I can?t get that feeling out of my head. At one point I thought that it might be best if we just broke up ? sometimes it feels like the relationship is just making us both more unhappy. Even though we do want to be together, it seems like going through this struggling together is making it worse by adding more stress, rather than being able to ?lighten the load? and be supportive of each other. Also sometimes I feel like I have to eat when/what he wants, rather than choosing what I would prefer. Because of my busy schedule, I don?t get to cook as much as I?d like and we end up eating out a lot.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I also went to a Halloween party on Saturday. I was excited about the party and thought it would be a good opportunity to have some fun. They pretty much had only alcohol and no food. I don?t really like to drink or get drunk so I found myself wishing there was food there so I would have something to do or have a reason to be there. Because of the noise and the drinking, it was impossible to actually have a conversation with someone, and I just felt disappointed after going to the party. I knew that if there had been food there that it would have turned into a binge. It also made me think how odd it is that binge drinking is such an accepted part of our culture, even though it?s just as damaging as binge eating (if not more so).",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I have talked to my therapist about the stress and also some of the issues I?ve been having with my boyfriend. Her advice was primarily that I need to spend more time taking care of myself because if I can?t take care of myself then I can?t be expected to take care of anyone else. I understand the point of this advice but I?ve seen my mom do the same when I was growing up. She always put me and my siblings before herself and I think that I?ve become the same way as I?ve gotten older. I try really hard to please others and put a lot of pressure on myself to do so.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I would like to spend more time to myself but I always feel obligated to spend time with my boyfriend, whether it?s working on homework or studying, grabbing lunch in between classes, watching tv or actually trying to do something fun. Oftentimes I do things with him just because he wants to. For example, he loves to mountain bike but I don?t really enjoy it much and I get scared doing it. As much as I?ve tried to get him to make friends with people who do enjoy it, I?ve sunk a lot of money into equipment and he guilt trips me into taking him. He won?t go and work out without me, so it seems like the blame is placed on me for not exercising enough. I am perfectly ok with doing ?boring? exercise like running/elliptical, but basically he only likes ?exciting? sports like biking and rockclimbing, which require a lot of planning and just makes me more stressed instead of alleviating stress. I don?t think he understands that I don?t like exercising when it?s purely on his terms, so we rarely actually do it. Honestly the only way for me to incorporate exercise into my schedule would be to wake up super early or exercise at night. But in the evening I?m usually with Jeremy and too tired to want to exercise.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"A bit of good news is that he will be going to a doctor about his ADHD (which is a step in the right direction) and the midterm we got back today didn?t go as badly as we thought it did. The adjustment in expectations has been really hard coming from top of the class and straight A?s to bottom of the class and worrying about passing. I think if I felt like I had more control in other areas of my life, I would be able to better control my eating. I?m not sure if it would be best for me to start calorie counting again to try to stick to a goal and have something to feel good about, but last year failing to meet those goals often lead to binging. I have a bit more time to process things right now and it helps to get it down in writing. I?ve also continued to go to the support group and I feel like that?s a really positive environment for me to share my struggles, even if others aren?t necessarily going through the same issues ? so I guess that?s at least one thing that I?m doing for myself. I can be completely honest and not worried about being judged. I can?t really talk to anyone I know in the department about these issues because they all know my boyfriend and I don?t want to make him look bad. I know that?s a long response to a simple question but I have so much weighing down on me. Thanks for your advice and for listening!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"In terms of eating, I prefer to pack my lunch while he always eats out. One positive note is that he does like when I cook food but I have a lot less time to do that this semester than I?d like. As an undergraduate, I usually brought my own food and was very picky about going out to eat (which sometimes lead to arguments). In terms of school, I?m constantly worried about helping him finish homework and study for exams, and stress out about his grades more than mine. He?s been talking about dropping out a lot recently, after a rough go on midterms. And if he drops out I feel like it will be my fault for not doing enough to help him. Last year when we were long distance I definitely had more time to do things on my own. I didn?t always enjoy visits though because there was even more pressure to make the most of that time. He also put a lot of pressure on me to lose weight, which probably contributed to developing bulimia symptoms.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes I have spoken with Jeremy about trying to improve my eating and he?s generally supportive, but I definitely agree that I?ve been putting so much energy into the relationship that it?s affecting other areas of my life (and that?s not really his fault). The sessions on automatic thoughts has been really helpful for me and I realize that I have so many of them! I guess thought the main here is ?If I don?t do everything I can to help, then I?m a bad girlfriend.? As I said, I try really hard to make other people happy and it comes at the expense of taking proper care of myself. I?ve never really thought to try to set some boundaries so I really have no idea how to go about doing it. The idea makes me uncomfortable, but I think that it might be a good thing to try and that Jeremy would be willing to consider it.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Although we do try to be supportive of each other, sometimes neither of us is very good at it given all of the circumstances. The main issue is that I think the best way to set boundaries would be with school work, but he has become completely dependent on me to finish homework assignments and study and he hasn?t sought help from anyone else. He feels like he?s too far behind that he?s embarrassed to get help from anyone else, so that puts all the pressure on me even though I?m not really the best person to get help from. I do hope that seeing a doctor about his ADHD again will be helpful, and I got a reference for him to see a counselor who specializes in ADHD and I hope that could help him figure out some ways to deal with it while also being in a very intense graduate program. I will try to get him to make an appointment, but it?s little things like that that are often very difficult to get him to do (again due to the ADHD)!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I do want to say that sharing all of this probably casts Jeremy in a bad light ? but he really is very caring and does try to be supportive of me. I also usually will talk to my parents or his parents about some of these issues and I sometimes feel like they only see the negatives that I share with them, rather than looking at what we?ve been able to accomplish together. It hurts me when they ?jokingly? wonder why I have been with him for so long, while on the other hand they will marginalize our relationship because we aren?t married. In their minds, a relationship isn?t really serious without being married, and there?s a whole other set of issues in terms of social expectations and family expectations regarding marriage. Even though I would want to get married, Jeremy has told me that he isn?t ready for that yet and I know deep down that it?s not actually the best decision for us right now. And I can?t help but feel jealous when looking at all the engagement and wedding photos on social media, often with people who haven?t been together nearly as long as us. This was something that we discussed in the support group and I found it to be extremely helpful. We?ve also talked about the possibility of moving in together next year (despite parental disapproval) because we already spend so much time together and I end up staying at his place about a third of the time. I?m not entirely sure if this would make things better or just lead to more interdependence?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"In terms of progress on eating habits, I?m not sure how to quantify it, but I guess a ?50% reduction? is probably closer to reality. I think that now I am still struggling with feeling guilty about eating, and that causes me to eat more than I actually want to. I would say that I don?t really have serious binges anymore (3000-5000 calories in one sitting), but I still feel like I?m eating too much on a regular basis. I think because I?ve altered between restricting and binge eating for about 10 years now I don?t really know how much I should be eating and I haven?t gotten to having a healthy relationship with food yet. I also feel like most of the progress was made at the beginning and I haven?t been making much progress over the last month or so. So it?s easy to lose sight of the progress that I have made and feel a bit frustrated with myself over the lack of recent progress.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also ? Maayan is actually the counselor I?m already seeing! Because university resources are pretty limited, I can?t see her more than once every two weeks even if I did have more time. She said that she would send me some other options for counseling outside of UHS that I could see on a more regular basis, but I don?t think I?d be able to go any more frequently if it requires me to go very far from campus.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi Anna - thanks again for the words of encouragement. Right now I'm worried about my midterm exam coming up on Friday. I feel like there's not enough time to properly prepare and that's just going to result in another bad test score. I'm also struggling with all of my homework still. It's like everything is so difficult I just don't want to do it anymore. I had a panic attack but Jeremy helped calm me down. I just hope we can get through this. Hopefully I will feel better next week after getting through some of this.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm also feeling some anxiety about my weight again. I think I've gained some weight and I feel really uncomfortable in my clothes. Every time I look in the mirror I just see myself as fat. I really want to lose weight but I've given up on trying, especially because my previous attempts just lead me to bulimic behavior. I've been feeling more tempted to use laxatives recently but have resisted that urge, knowing that it just makes me feel sick and doesn't help with the underlying problem. On the other hand, I feel like I'm consistently eating more than I actually want to. I will eat foods I don't really want just because they are there. I'm also having problems with sneaking food, sometimes taking my roommates' food and hoping they won't notice. I know this is a horrible, horrible habit but I keep doing it anyway :(",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna ? actually the test went ok. I did slightly below average and I?m ok with that. Jeremy?s score was slightly lower than mine and he was a bit disappointed with his score but did not get stressed about it. I think it?s a combination of being better prepared for this exam (the average was much higher than in our other two courses) and some adjusted expectations in our performance relative to the class. Now that midterms are over and the semester is quickly coming to an end ? I think I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. I think now I can take a bit more time to relax and take better care of myself (and finally start an exercise routine which is long overdue). At this point, it?s getting through a few more weeks of homework and then studying for finals. After talking with some of my professors, I?m pretty confident that I can prepare (with Jeremy) well enough so that we both pass our prelims in January (this is an oral exam that we have to pass in order to be able to stay in the PhD program ? it?s very high stakes so high stress!!!)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,This weekend Jeremy?s dad came into town. It was a nice visit except whenever his family comes over they like to ?treat us? with food ? and that causes a lot of stress for me. They like to order A LOT of EXPENSIVE food. My mom would always make me feel guilty about wasting food as a kid so I used to have a big problem with eating out and needing to finish my plate. Even still I tend to eat fast so I don?t feel full and stop eating soon enough. I will also continue to eat as long as food is in front of me even if I don?t really want it or I?m full.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes I?ve been experiencing a lot of negative feelings about my body again. I think it?s because I had been stress eating and had gained some weight and feel really uncomfortable with my body right now. All I can think about is how much thinner I used to be (probably 15-20 pounds, I?ve stopped weighing myself because it causes too much stress for me) and that I wish I could be that thin again. My therapist said that as long as I am working on my eating and develop a healthy relationship with food that my weight will go where it naturally should be, but I definitely don?t think I?m there yet. I?m much better off than I was when starting the program but I don?t think I?ve improved much compared how I felt in high school when I was at a similar weight.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also I'm not sure if I've told you this but when I was a junior and senior in college I took antidepression medication for anxiety and depression (I also have a family history of these issues). Since I've been feeling a very strong resurgence of those emotions in grad school I've been thinking that perhaps I should try taking them again. I originally stopped taking them because I felt like I didn't really need them and they didn't have much of an effect on me - but I was on a low dosage so maybe I should have had a higher dosage. I don't know if this type of medication can help with recovery from an ED? I know that anxiety and depression are highly linked to ED as underlying causes so I think that if the medication is effective and can give me a general improvement in mood, it would help me with overcoming school and eating issues.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"The good news was that I feel like I was able to get through the experience without bingeing and with much improvement over bad habits (stopping eating sooner, not getting too full). Jeremy insisted that how much I ate was fine, but the whole even was extremely stressful for me, which then also made me feel guilty because Jeremy?s dad was trying to do something nice for us and it just ends up being really unpleasant for me. I feel so trapped because I feel like I can?t be honest about my disorder, but at least Jeremy was there to be supportive of me and I think that made a big difference.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna ? Sorry it?s been a while since I last checked in. I decided to get that prescription from my doctor and I think that it?s been helping me a bit so far but I?ll have to see what the effects are in the long run. At first I was a bit hesitant about going into Phase II because I liked having the daily check-ins. Recently I?ve been feeling a lot better and I haven?t been binging. However, I am worried about finals and prelims coming up and I?m really worried about Jeremy because he hasn?t been motivated to do his work and now he really needs to study. He?s worried about passing his classes and I hope that he can learn enough in the next few weeks to pass. I guess the worst case scenario would be if he fails a final, and if that happens I don?t know what the consequences would be. But I know that he would probably be so discouraged that he might give up on grad school. It?s been really difficult for me to accept that I can?t really help him with his school work and I can?t motivate him to do it either. He doesn?t have a back up plan if grad school doesn?t work out, so that leaves a lot of unknowns that are very stressful for me. Writing out the scenarios didn?t really help me much as I don?t really know what the actual results will be and I don?t even know how likely they are. I went to visit my grandparents with my family over Thanksgiving so it was really nice to see everyone again. Thanksgiving went ok for me foodwise ? as usual, I ate too many sweets. But overall I felt like I did ok and I stopped eating when I wanted to. 
I?d be free for a call sometime this week: Tuesday/Wednesday/Friday after 11 am or Thursday 11 AM ? 1 PM (all PST).",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna - It's been a while since I last checked in with the program because I was studying for an taking finals and then went home for winter break. I passed all of my classes and thankfully my boyfriend did too. I was very stressed throughout the semester over the possibility that either one of us might not be able to make it through. I was very relived and happy when exams were over and I found out that we both passed. I had a fairly relaxed winter break and went home to Dallas to visit my family. Now I'm back at school and studying for my prelimary exams. These are oral exams that we have to take that cover material from college. It's required that we pass to stay in the program, so it's stressful to say the least, but the studying has been going ok so far. In terms of eating, my habits have been pretty stable except for indulging in a few too many treats over the holidays - but I would say no binging. For the new year and new semester, I'm hoping to focus on exercising more and eating healthier. I'm actually quite excited for the semester once I get through prelims. Like I said, even though I've been stressed, my eating habits have been normal. I've been drinking a lot of tea instead of snacking - so that would be replacing a bad habit with a good one. My exams are next Thursday and Friday - hopefully I will have some more good news by then.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"It's just interfering with going about life normally like eating becomes such a big deal because I want a ton of food but I don't want to eat too much and then I feel really guilty about it.

Thanks so much!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Jacqui, sorry, I totally forgot about it yesterday. I had a pretty bad last couple of days with all my eating issues. It's kind of intimidating to track all the failures I've had.

,,,,"Thanks Jacqui! I have that mentality that once I failed, then ""screw it.""

,,,,"Hi Anna - no worries, Friday at 4:45 Pacific time would work for me if you get this in time! Also if it's better for you we can also find a time on Monday. What you said about using my feelings to help plan meals makes a lot of sense, and also helps me to really think about when I might be vulnerable to struggling and plan ways to cope before I get to the actual eating. I'll try this out, thanks!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna - sure, we can schedule a phone chat. I could probably do Friday afternoon if that works for you. I am on Pacific time - are you as well? The tracking has been going alright. I just started using the planning feature too. I've been tracking my food (for calories and macronutrients) recently on a different program, so it's interesting to also consider the things other than food that are part of a meal (time, location, company). Should I be paying attention to anything else in particular when I'm recording?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,P.S. I also meant to ask if you had any thoughts about this too!,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna - it was great to talk to you yesterday! I just did the learning exercise today on dieting, and I have a question. I was interested to read about some of the negative effects of restricting calories on both body and mind. I've also heard about studies showing that calorie restriction (in rats, I think) is actually beneficial to health and reduces cancer risk, etc and I've heard a lot of stuff recently about intermittent fasting and its benefits. I don't know much about these topics - it seems to me there must be some sort of balance. Do you have any suggested further reading that addresses these?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also, I was wondering if I could ask you a question about yourself: I heard in your video that you are working towards your clinical psychology degree. How did you get involved with the HBI program? Is it part of your research? Just curious what brought you to this program too, if that's alright to ask!

-Jackie",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"This is good information, thanks! I wasn't familiar with any human literature on dieting, so this is helpful to know. And I suppose that studying humans is ultimately the most relevant. I will definitely work to keep a regular eating schedule and see how it feels after I do it for a while.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna - I did try some of the chain-breaking strategies today. I was planning to go home for lunch but I ended up being delayed and got very hungry. I recognized this as a situation where I might be tempted to binge when I got home, so I bought a meal out instead. It was too large, so I divided it before eating and boxed half. So the urges were still there, but I was able to address them more or less with actions. I liked the exercise because it allowed me to dissect thoughts and feelings that otherwise meld together into causal relationships. Thanks for the reminder to try it out, that was helpful because I don't always remember to apply the lessons to everyday life!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna - self-care is definitely an area I'd like to work on. I tend to feel guilty (""I could be doing work right now""), and if I plan time for relaxation sometimes I'll work into that time and not respect the boundaries. I realize this is totally not working because what ends up happening is that I end up stretching out my work to fill the large empty space I've carved out (when it shouldn't actually take that long) or doing low-intensity activities (surfing web and losing track of time, wondering whether I should be taking a break) instead of things that re-energize me. I do better if I have a rigid schedule, so I sometimes feel quite lost during weekends!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think that by focusing on other people and practicing really listening to them, it will mean stronger relationships and I think I spend too much time over-analyzing myself and what others think of me, so if I can turn that attention to my actual interactions with other people (without also over-analyzing them, just showing by my words and actions that I care) I think that would be good. The other day I read a quote: ""The way to be interesting is to first be interested"" which I've been reflecting on recently.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna - I relate to the lack of structured eating on the weekends. I also tend to be home more, which makes snacking easier than when I'm out and about.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"For the body image tracking, doing it (sort of) regularly did draw my attention to moments when I thought about my body during the day. Often the trigger will be visual (e.g., seeing myself in mirror, etc), and it also seemed to be related to my mood at the time - if I was disappointed or frustrated, sometimes I would drift into negative thoughts about my body. Conversely, exercising and using my body for activity (even riding my bike fast while running late haha) made me feel good.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I guess what tends to work for weekends is if I schedule a few things throughout the day - I'll sometimes avoid scheduling things with other people because I feel shy or worried that it won't go well, but maybe I can try motivating myself by remembering it will be better in the long run. And start small - just plan one small thing. I will try that for next weekend (I'll be traveling this weekend).",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I did try the mirror exercise - I guess it wasn't terribly pleasant, not so much because I didn't like looking (it was kind of a check in, I noted positives and negatives), but because it didn't feel that weird to be doing it, which is when I really realized that I spend several minutes a day analyzing myself in the mirror already. I feel like that time could be spent better.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"That makes sense about recognizing where the positive and negative thoughts are coming from. Also reading about criticism today, I realized that a lot of the techniques presented for dealing with other people's criticism can be applied to self-criticism. Having instructions in how to deal with it will be good, I just have to make sure I recognize it first.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also Anna I was with family this weekend and had a lot of trouble with food and bingeing and eating at restaurants. I wrote about it on the most recent break the chain exercise. It was worse not at restaurants since there was eating available all the time and I couldn't stop. I tried to slow down and breath and remove myself from the situation but it only temporarily worked. I don't know what to do besides strictly adhere to my own food habits/rules, which are fine when I'm by myself, but when that's upset by being in a different food environment, everything goes wrong!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"The body checking can go either way - if I like what I see then it can make me feel better, if not, then I don't feel that great. It doesn't really seem to be that objective, since one day I'll feel good and another bad, which can't really be the case because my body doesn't change that quickly!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna - you're right, I have a lot of tools that can help me in these situations, I just have to recognize, categorize, and apply. It helps to label things like ""setback"" and ""strategy"" just so I have something very concrete to work with. This weekend, I think that I could have planned my meals, or at least the times when I would eat them since I didn't always know what they would be. Within that, if people were ordering many things like appetizers, I think I could have planned before the food came what I was going to eat. So that's the pre-vulnerable situation planning.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"For the next day or so, I feel like I need to recover a bit, but then the next step I would like to do is the forbidden foods exercise (I think that I actually ate most of my forbidden foods this weekend! But not in a controlled manner, so it's important to do) If I can have access to these foods but only take what I want/am hungry for at that particular time, that would be great. So I will try buying one of these foods next time I go to the grocery store and incorporate it into my meals I cook.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"During the situation, I think I could have responded differently when I realized I was slipping out of control - I think that I thought I could willpower through it, but I couldn't. So when that happens, I need to make it my number one priority of that moment to ground myself (I liked those exercises) through breathing, observation of surroundings, or some other distraction.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Sorry for all the messages - another thing I thought of that I could have done was eaten more slowly. I'm thinking of trying to eat slowly enough so that it takes 20 minutes minimum (if I'm eating by myself) just to train myself at first, and then relax the time constraint. What do you think about that? And would you add or change anything about the suggestions I wrote above?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My forbidden foods are calorie-dense, and by avoiding them I generally eat larger volumes of lower calorie foods - I think this has altered my conception of the size of a meal, since my portions are large volume-wise but not calorie-wise. If I am eating out, I try to pick something that avoids these foods. If I'm in a situation where it's necessary to eat a forbidden food (nothing else to eat, don't want to be rude, etc, or it just looks really good!), I often feel guilty. I don't buy these foods due to guilt usually. Plus if I do binge, I can't eat them if they're not around.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes, I definitely see what you're saying about the willpower - I guess the key is not to rely on willpower, but instead change our environment so we don't have to. And I know you've emphasized it before, but it's starting to click more about eating regularly so that I'm never too hungry - I think that I was afraid that if I snacked that it would set off a binge, so I avoided snacks. Now I'm seeing that this can be a good exercise, to eat something small that won't completely satiate me like a meal will, but will ward off hunger - although it will take some time to get into this habit.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna - regarding regular eating: at meal times I definitely feel calmer when I prepare or cook food if I'm not super hungry, so that's a plus. It's been not super consistent though, sometimes I'll be able to eat slowly and mindfully and other times I'm rushing and eating standing up, etc. I've noticed that when I'm in a rushing mindset, I'll start thinking about eating something else before I'm even done with my current meal. This is a big flag to me to gauge how vulnerable I am at that time.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"and didn't go back for more or graze at them. It really helped to have a set amount that I was going to eat and to stick to that. But I'm still kind of worried about having something like chips or nuts in the house - I might buy a loaf of bread, plan some meals with it, and then freeze what I don't need for the meals, because the freezing can act as a barrier to bingeing if necessary. Does that sound reasonable?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"For the forbidden foods, I feel guilty eating them, not so much that they trigger a binge. However, if I am eating out of control (usually not triggered by food itself), these foods are the ones I gravitate towards because they're easy (no prep required). But they also make me feel the worst because it can add up to a lot of calories very quickly. So that's why I won't stock them in my pantry. I still haven't bought any, but yesterday I went to dinner at a friend's and had tortilla chips - I decided that I would have a handful, put the quantity on my plate, ate it,",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, With the chips I think that I was sort of treating it like an experiment and I had a very precise goal in mind - eat a food I was uncomfortable with in an unfamiliar situation and see if I could stay in control. And it was important to me that I proved it to myself, so when I had doubt I recognized it but then moved on, paid attention to a conversation instead, and had a drink.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also I bought my bread and have it planned to eat as snacks for the week (trying to kill two birds with forbidden foods and eating regularly!). Thanks for your support and your questions, they encourage me to probe a little further into the reasons behind my actions and feelings!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hmm, I think that if I get nervous or worried about things (can be small things that don't really matter), I tend to try to push those feelings away - sometimes I replace them with self-criticizing or frustration, other times I just try not to feel it, distract myself, and often it gets better with time. I am most successfully able to deal with this emotions by taking a break where I don't think about the thing that's bothering me, and then come back and attack it with a plan/list. However, I don't always manage to do this.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"The snacks are going according to plan - I found some interesting bread pumpkin seed crust :) and it hasn't been difficult because I have exactly the number of slices I need for each day of the week, and I've been focusing on it. I also bought some nuts, which I wasn't planning to do but they're some of my favorite, and I put them on a high shelf so I have to think about it I actually want them, and have had a few controlled portions (i.e., measured).",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It feels good that I know I can do it in a controlled manner, and that I am able to eat small snacks. I'm still getting used to the feeling of doing something that has the potential to be uncontrollable in a controlled manner, which can sometimes feel like I'm at the edge of something but I think most of the like it's not like I'm going to fall off the edge but rather pushing the boundary.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"This weekend, I have two dinners at friends' houses that are worrying me - at one, she is going to cook something (but doesn't know what yet) and we're supposed to maybe bring small things, and the other is a potluck. These are exactly the situations that I struggle with. I was thinking of a few things: first, trying to have some more control by bringing a food I feel safe eating - I might offer to bring a salad (also at these events sometimes vegetables are overlooked!) for both nights. Also I could try the technique where I don't snack on appetizers, but have a drink instead and then only eat one plate with exactly what I want on it.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also I've been using the ""count"" grounding exercise where you find things you can see, hear, and feel and count down, which I like a lot because it focuses my attention outwards and is calming. So I could try that probably before the event, and during if need be. I also think I will not try any desserts because those tend to make me spiral down. Do you have any other suggestions or comments? I know it's a bit restrictive but I'd rather this than a binge.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna - yes, I like those ideas too and feel more prepared. I have it set what I'm bringing, and I had kind of forgotten about the regular eating thing again, so thanks for the reminder. I now have tomorrow planned out with regards to meals and snacks and will do the same thing for Saturday. And I'll take some time to plan what I'll eat once I get to the dinners. I also identified a few people who I'd like to talk to, so I can look out for them to start a conversation after I've finished eating and want to move on.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna - sorry I've been away for a few days! This weekend went alright, there were both things that went well and those that went poorly. Helpful things included not being very hungry before I went (had a snack), bringing a food I felt safe with as my main course and supplementing with other dishes, and focusing on conversations with people (this wasn't too hard because I liked the people a lot!).",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think that the situations for this weekend and my slip up weekend with my family are quite similar, but now I feel better prepared and it's kind of fun to think of it as a challenge that I've planned out rather than a hard slog that I'm just going to slop through.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Overall I had a very nice time, and was sort of able to observe my binge behavior even though in the moment I didn't talk action to try to stop it early on. The first night I did have dessert and it was ok!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Not so good things: the second night I started off very well and felt in control, but as it got later and I got more tired I started snacking and it tumbled into uncontrollable. But oddly I didn't really feel that bad about it as usual - I think what didn't work is that I had a plan to not have any dessert because I was worried that would be a trigger, but I think I should have just had dessert in moderation. Also if I feel myself coming to this point, next time I will just leave because I'm not really enjoying the party due to struggling, so it's probably best to just go rest.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes I do think that being tired is a trigger for me - mornings are easier for me than evenings in terms of eating, for example. Hmm well to be honest I'm out of ideas at the moment for how to avoid a binge without avoiding the situation - I guess it would depend on how out-of-control I felt. This particular night I felt strongly, but maybe if I felt less so I could try taking a break to reset myself, maybe go out and get some fresh air and breathe a bit.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Also I have a technical question: is there a way for me to see the responses and exercises I've completed on this program? I just thought it would be nice to review what I've written about the last few weeks.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, I did have a good weekend, how about you? Yes I've liked the cognitive reframing exercises a lot. I feel like I have a lot of automatic thoughts throughout the day, and so I like understanding a bit more about what's going on in my brain when they occur, and ways to tackle them. I like putting them into categories because they feel more manageable that way. What do you think of cognitive reframing as a tool?",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, That's good to hear about the normal-ness, sometimes I forget that other people are going through the same things since I don't really talk about these sorts of things with people. Hmm I hadn't really tried the cognitive reframing with eating specifically, so I did one eating-related today. I guess what often happens is that I have a non-eating related trigger and then experience out of control eating as part of my response, but I can treat the thoughts I have when that is happening in the same way.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also quick follow-up on my earlier technical question: I can see my history (using my computer), which has all of the lessons and techniques. But I can't find the things that I wrote. Should I be able to see those somewhere too?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I have another question: I've been pretty diligent about the regular eating (3 meals, 2 snacks) and in many ways I like it. However, one of the reasons I initially got rid of snacks in my normal food intake was because if I brought a snack, I would think about it and possibly eat it before planned. Now my schedule is such that I only have specific periods of the day during which I can eat, and when I get done with something often I'll turn straight to the snack (not necessarily because I'm hungry, just because it's food I guess?). This is like a binge mentality without the out of control eating because I only have a small amount of food with me. I really don't like this feeling, but it sticks around even though I physically can't over-indulge. Any thoughts or suggestions about this? I'm also nervous about what will happen when my schedule is not as regimented (holidays, breaks, when I'm not taking classes, etc).",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thinking about it more, I'm more likely to reach for the snack if I have unstructured time, or if I am bored or frustrated/upset with whatever I'm doing. If I am being productive sometimes I still think about it but am more able to resist and quickly get back to work.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi Anna - thanks for looking into the history viewing! I'm going to think about your question regarding the snacking a bit more and try to identity/pay attention to when these feelings are more prevalent - I'll get back to you. But also for the reporting I didn't mean to report 5 of each!!! I'm not sure what happened I tried to click 3 binges and 0 vomiting and laxatives. Thanks for checking on that!,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, Thanks for the overall update on the HBI program. I actually did make an appointment with my counseling center last week - it's in another week, so we'll see how it goes. I think that this program was good in that it was practice committing to something. I will try committing to a few sessions of in person counseling and give it a fairer shot.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I definitely have thought about and worried about the holidays. But I've also been thinking about ways to address these concerns instead of spiraling into more anxiety - the meal planning for special events section was a helpful reminder of things discussed during the program. For me, I think the big things I'll focus on are: bringing some food that I feel comfortable with if possible, eating regular meals and staying hydrated throughout the day to prepare, planning what I will eat before I take anything at the event, focusing on the event itself/people at the event. I will also try not avoiding all desserts, since that didn't work so well last time, but instead choose one thing and enjoy.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks for saying that, that's a good thing to remember that when I speak with the therapist I'm half of the conversation, so I get to choose how it goes as well. Also I was reading something talking about how to manage healthy eating during the holidays and it stressed sleeping, exercising, and practicing mindfulness/relaxation as well as identifying eating strategies. I appreciated this, since all these things really affect how you feel and can contribute to healthy eating behavior. Since trouble with eating often has a spiral effect, it only takes a couple of these things to get out of whack and there's a problem! So I think that when I plan out my week for the next few weeks, I'll include a little check in with these other important things as well. I'm trying to not go overboard because then I won't follow through, but I think that this little check will be worth it. Do you think that makes sense?",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also for phase 2, I saw that it's recommended to use the program once per week, and I also see 6 more units - are these all part of phase 2? Are there subsections in each unit or is it one unit per week?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I just finished the last session, and yes another phone chat would be great! Perhaps next week (i.e., the week of Nov 30)? What times of the day are you usually free? I can do mornings before 10 am Pacific time any day, and am free Tuesday and Thursday until noon Pacific time. I read about how session 2 is going to work a bit, and am looking forward to the next step and working on building these habits.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, Regarding a few messages above: that is what I meant about checking in - I usually write down my week goals on an index card anyway, so as part of that I could include a reflection on the previous week and a goal for the next week. Thanks for asking about the viewing previous responses! There's not a certain thing in particular that I wanted to review, I was more just curious if I would be able to see any changes in my responses over the past several weeks. It's not a big deal for me, but if I understand correctly this program is still in development? If so, I think it's really important to be able to track progress as well as plan, and so if the web interface could accommodate that, I think that it would make the program even stronger.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, Thanksgiving went pretty well - it was a bit out of the ordinary because I was on a camping trip for the whole weekend (which was great!) so it was a potluck that I had little idea how it was going to work (there were limited plates, kind of just took pieces of things). I brought something I liked to eat, took breaks to talk to people and admire the scenery around me. Towards the end of the meal I over ate a bit (combination of a lot of new stuff going on) but didn't feel guilty really. We repeated this type of meal several times, and by the end I felt more comfortable with it. And I tried a lot of good food!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I did have the therapy session, thanks for checking. It was alright, I think that the first one was a bit draining because it covered a lot and was kind of a general gauge, but I will go back to talk to the same therapist next week. I didn't feel stressed from pressure to share. One thing she asked me to do a lot was to rate my feelings on scales (and this program also does this), which I found difficult. I've just been going with gut feeling and trying to imagine the extremes when I do these ratings - does that sound reasonable?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna! Sorry that I have been out of touch for a bit - I finished exam week and traveled back home so I have a break new for several weeks. Regarding feedback on the program: there's something else I thought would be nice for Phase 1 - for some of the exercises the program encouraged you to do them multiple times per day, which I thought was great. But it would also send many emails per day, which I don't think is the most effective for everyone (for example, I purposely don't receive email notifications, so I would open my email to a stack of reminder emails from Lantern which was sometimes a bit much). I really like the accountability aspect of this, but I think it could be implemented differently. If I think of other things, I will let you know!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I would say the last week or so of the term was another setback for me. I felt that up until then I had been pretty in control of eating, and hadn't had many binges, but the last week I had several and didn't feel particularly in control, especially at two parties I went to. Analyzing it, I think that there were several trigger factors present: stress and less sleep and exercise than usual, all of which compromise my ability to make good decisions. In addition, I did not adequately prepare myself for situations which I knew would be problematic for me. So I've seen that relapse into old habits happens, but that the environment I put myself in is hugely important in retraining myself. I took the opportunity in coming home to reset, rest, and I feel pretty good at the moment. I talked to my mom about junk food in the house, and we agreed that we would limit its presence save for a couple traditions. So far, this is really helping with avoiding triggers but still consuming sweets in moderation.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks for listening, like I said it really helps to explain my thinking and plans because it crystallizes in my mind too!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, Things have been pretty good. I enjoyed Christmas food, including some treats in moderation. I had one out of control eating episode that wasn't too major. I think that I understand well about who I need to set myself up to not binge, but still need to work on tactics in the moment to cope (I notice bingeing happens in the evening/night for me almost all the time). I went through the techniques and reminded myself of which ones I like and have been using regularly (such as meditation and prevention techniques), and also ones that I'd like to try out again (habit building, opposite action, some on-the-spot breathing techniques). And I think I can use break the chain after I have trouble, for example a binge. I hope you had a nice Christmas!!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, I've really enjoyed the gratitude exercises - taking a moment in the evening or end of the week to reflect, and especially putting the events in a positive light, brings nice closure. And I like that gratitude isn't about covering up things that didn't go well or unhappy feelings - you can experience these but still feel grateful for things around or maybe even involved in the bad things. Lately I've been more regular with journaling, and it's a nice exercise to included gratefulness lists - I looked back at a gratefulness journal I kept over a year ago, and it made me smile to reread it! Journaling also helps if I'm not feeling good to organize my thoughts and feelings and sometimes move on - so in summary, for me writing is a powerful method of making sense of the things in my life. I recently read (okay, it's a really big book so I *almost* finished it) an anthology of diary entries called ""The Assassin's Cloak"" which I loved! (I'd definitely recommend it :) ) It inspired me to get back into journaling myself.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, Regarding the journaling, reading other people's diary entries was a chance to see everything (the mundane and the noteworthy, both with respect to individuals and with respect to world/national events) observed and recorded through different eyes and pens. I realized that I wanted both a record of what I'm up to, and that it's an interesting way to process things and to practice writing. I guess I just wanted to be part of recording daily life!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you for the information and check-in: I haven't gone to another appointment since I returned at school, but I think that I will set up another one because I promised myself to try it out, I think I can benefit from it, and so far I liked the therapist I saw which is important. So I'll investigate how to set up another appointment with her. :)",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I had to cancel my therapist appointment and reschedule for next week - I'll let you know how it goes! I've been thinking about two major things lately: the first is habit formation and second is automatic thoughts (especially negative ones). With automatic thoughts, I've been trying to catch myself and rephrase my language, since I find myself thinking in black and white but then even if I use different language (such as instead of ""I should have done X instead of Y"" saying ""I could have done Y but I did X, and it's fine"").",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"For habits, I'm still trying to eat more mindfully and not be so impulsive around food. I did a little test where I challenged myself to not snack while preparing meals (if I was hungry, I would sit down and have a proper snack, so I wasn't restricting) for 3 days, then I would take 2 days off and not worry about it, then back to 3 day challenge. It was pretty good for a while. I somehow stopped doing it - I think what was missing was a reward, like use the time I would have wasted aimlessly grazing to do something I enjoy. So I might try that. What do you think about this experimental strategy?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, I completely forgot about doing Lantern this week! I'll put it on my calendar for the future. :) Just to check: the recommendation is to complete one session weekly, right? I saw the changes to the layout, but I don't use the phone app so that's fine.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I have experienced flow during studying. working, test taking, physical activity, etc. Not so much recently, because I feel like I'm starting a lot of new stuff and it's hard to get that feeling when you're just trying to get your feet under you. But I think it will come!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, I did find the challenge inherently rewarding in that it allowed me to be more mindful around food and I don't like the out-of-control feeling that I sometimes experience, and it diminished that. I think the extra reward would be especially geared to the short term, since that's the hardest point at which to recognize the longer-term benefits and resist the temptation just because it's ingrained. I still haven't rescheduled the appointment, I guess I've been dragging my feet a bit but I put it on my to do list for tomorrow along with the phone number so I have no excuses!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, No I didn't feel any pressure from you! I do want to go again, and I will let you know how it goes when I do. I appreciate you asking!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna - this semester is academically challenging for me (hard class, uncertain situation regarding joining a research lab, feel a bit perpetually behind). Not last week but the week before I felt myself slipping food-wise and had a couple of binges. Now I am back to tracking my meals (3 meals plus 1 snack) and this is helping. I guess I struggle with consistency - when things are fine, I feel like I can usually stay on top of food and exercise but then if some piece goes, everything goes and it takes a while to get back on track. I am also starting to train for a half marathon, and this so far has been a great way to put myself on an exercise and eating schedule to take care of myself! That's how things are at the moment - I've also incorporated some meditation into my morning routine to try it out.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, Yes what you said resonated with me - having the schedule, and including self-care in that schedule is really important but it's easy to forget unless I make it really explicit! I liked the audio guides on fun and smiling - the were reminders that it is ok and healthy to do these things and that you don't have to have a super fun thing planned in order to enjoy your day and add some humor into it. I also find when I catch myself frowning it is such a relief to smile (even a little bit with the inside of my mouth and eyes), my face feels so much more relaxed!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also, I finally had another appointment with the therapist I saw a couple of times. It went fine - she asks me to rate how I'm feeling on a scale, similar to how this program has a lot of scales. At first I found that really difficult but it's becoming easier with practice. She focuses on guiding me towards positive thinking - for example, if I rate my mood as low, she asks ""Why was it not even lower?"" It took me 3 sessions before I finally realized what she meant, but I think I get it now! The point as I understand it is to explicitly identify what circumstances or activities or practices boost mood, productivity, sense of control, and happiness, and then develop them into strategies. I think I'll try to see her every 2-3 weeks for a while - it's helpful for me to verbalize these things and get feedback!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, I identified with the energy quadrant, and especially with how it changes throughout the day. For me, I notice dips in energy after lunch, and then usually in the evening I feel tired but sometimes I still try to get work done, but end up being frustrated because I'm slower and less productive. One thing I might try is to organize my to do list based on how much energy or focus tasks take, that way I can pick them based on how I'm feeling. This might be especially helpful during the evening slot, because I could get easier things done that I need to or want to do anyway. That might even take the form of setting a time after which I pack up work that takes more focus and energy, and pick up other tasks, which might also help relax me before going to sleep.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, finals were last week and I am glad to be done! I'm having trouble finding a thesis adviser for my PhD which has involved a lot of meetings a logistics and uncertainty and I'm kind of tired from all of it. This has also substantially eroded at my willpower, which has not been so good for my eating and exercising. I haven't really been exercising the past two weeks, and have been skipping my half marathon training. I hadn't been bingeing hardly at all during the winter, but over the last two weeks it's become more frequent and I'm frustrated because I feel like I was on a pretty good roll but I'm never able to keep it going. So it's as if I'm still using willpower to keep myself honest, as opposed to having a rock solid habit built. I guess it will take time, and for now I have to focus on getting myself back to where I want to be. What I've found helpful earlier includes having a solid morning routine (including exercise, meditation, and breakfast), and planning meals. I'm struggling most around/after dinner with food, and so I need to think about what to do there. Do you have any recommendations for things to consider?",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna - hmm thinking back I recall a few things that may have had an impact. I wasn't adhering to my normal morning routine, and started not exercising at all because I hurt my foot (but I could have found other ways to exercise, that's not an excuse to quit altogether!). I also was eating out more, and I had bought more trigger foods. I had been reintroducing them into the house because they'd been ok, but then when my normal routine was derailed, that was a problem situation for me! I've been feeling better the past several days. I kind of reached a plateau of peace with my adviser search for now, got back to exercising, and I've been wearing my retainer when I cook food, which prevents me from mindless grazing and triggering situations, and I take it out when I sit down and am ready to have my meal. I'm thinking of this as a retraining device!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, Thanks for the heads up on the app. Thinking more about emotional and social triggers, I had been feeling upset more often during my prone-to-bingeing period, and I notice that I would get upset about something in particular and then binge in response to my negative emotions. I am making mistakes in school and it almost sort of feels like I've messed all this stuff, so there's not a lot of motivation to eat right and take care of myself. I think these are examples of black and white thinking and negative core beliefs. I might try revisiting those exercises because if I can reframe my thinking when I'm calm, I might have a better shot of succeeding at it when I'm not feeling calm.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna,
I'm sorry for sort of disappearing for a few weeks - thanks very much for your support and encouragement! I guess that I wanted to tell you some progress I was making or something, but things have been kind of stagnant and so I just kind of waited and kept putting it off, but I know that isn't a sustainable way of dealing with things, so sorry for doing that! Still working with some challenges in eating, but I revisited the breaking the chain exercise, and I think that there are two spots that could be leveraged: first, setting up myself for success with respect to willpower (this includes getting enough sleep, which I don't think I've been doing because I've had trouble falling asleep and so put it off too). Second, recognizing when I feel sad and using other methods besides eating to feel better. I have a list, I think I just need to check it out and pick something in those times. I'm kind of worried in general about compulsive, addictive behaviors, including eating and checking my phone and email and social media, which I don't think is good for me. This has been on my mind lately.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,I will work more diligently on the last few sessions of the program!,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna - that makes sense, somehow I just lost sight of it! Thanks :) The emotions that tend to trigger emotional eating for me include sadness, boredom, and anxiety/worry (mostly the last one has been responsible lately). Only negative emotions though. On my list of things that brighten my mood are cleaning or home maintenance/fun projects (makes me feel productive and refreshes my mental state), knitting, exercising (although lately it's been a bit of a struggle to exercise), and listening to music or radio. The thing is I often don't make use of the things on this list - if I'm feeling upset about work I usually think I need to work harder but then it sometimes ends up backfiring because I don't take time to refresh and just end up not really working but also not really resting.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"But I do think that stepping away from my work at a certain point helps - for example, taking trips for vacation usually is nice for me. I also need to learn to just be okay with plugging along at work when it's uncertain and nonlinear, just breaking it down and doing the pieces.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, I have taken deliberate breaks in the past to do things that are restful. For example, I've taken days in the weekend totally off and done things with friends like going someplace new for a hike or to explore. That's great because often it's helpful to be with other people. When I need a quick break from work just by myself, sometimes I try rewarding myself with things like knitting or writing or doing some physical activity. Sometimes this works well, and I come back to my task refreshed, sometimes I get distracted in my reward and don't get back to work, or taking the break stresses me out. Maybe I can focus on when each of these feelings occur - writing this out makes me realize I don't know what causes which state of mind, which may be helpful to know.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, regarding your first message: I think that although I understand pretty well how I learn, I still am working on getting a feel for how to work effectively and have compassion for myself when I perceive myself as being lazy. This is a work in progress! I would love to chat again to wrap up - can you tell me some times that would work for you next week? Also, I've kind of fallen a bit behind on the sessions but I do want to finish them - can you tell me how many more there are so I can pace myself through them?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Do you have any strategies you've personally found helpful to effectively communicate?,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, I did have a good weekend, I hope yours was nice as well! Effective communication is something that I would like to improve on. Often I find myself overthinking a conversation, and worrying about how others might view my words. However, I think the most important thing is to just say what needs to be said! One of my best friends from this year is really good at this - she's communicates to the point of bluntness sometimes, but I really appreciate it because it gets stuff done and I know she won't hid stuff that she's thinking. I'm trying to learn from her! Also, the Lantern session made me think about a conversation I had with my roommate - she had taken a class about how to design your working environment, and one of the modules was designing conversations with the other person as the focus. I think it's important to establish your own needs and wants, and then think about the relationship from the other person's perspective to decide how best to approach the interaction to be mutually beneficial for both parties. This is something I'll have to actively practice until it becomes more natural!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, thanks, I'm glad I participated in and completed the program! Totally agree about the be interested to be interesting!! I've found that for me it really helps to ask engaged, genuine questions and usually people will open up.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi Anna thanks very much for your message! I really appreciate all your support and help over the past several months. You were really good at asking questions that helped me probe what was going on and distilling the crux of what I was saying without diminishing any part of it. I enjoyed our conversations a lot and the reason the program was useful to me was mainly due to the interaction with and feedback from you. I will miss messaging and talking to you but feel confident that I can use the same skills we've worked on together moving forward. Thanks Anna and I wish you the best as well!!,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, it's nice to meet you here! I just read about the goals of the lantern platform. One thing i'm concerned about however: I think Lantern is trying to make me feel better, but i think my issue is that I care too less about my issue. I understand my issue (eat too much and too unhealthy) very clearly, but I care about it too less when i eat, and i usually feel a bit guilty or not even guilty after I eat. I do feel annoyed about my current shape and weight from time to time, but I do think I should feel more concerned about them when I eat.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

But answering your question- burdening people is tough for me but also I do not want to scare them. My past disordered eating has been a deep secret for me that only a chosen few know about and those are the only people I reach out to, if ever. It's very shameful for me so I usually never reach out out of the obvious shame and embarrassment.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It's been homecoming week at my school so I have been very busy. I'm sorry I didn't get back to you more quickly but the tracking helps. I feel accountable. When I feel like binging or Purging I think having to log it and from what I've been learning, compensatory behaviors don't solve anything so I have been trying to eat more mindfully. I am very critical of my body, especially since I have gained some weight. I have a horrible habit of looking back on pictures where I was thinner",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,I don't think my last message sent but sorry I have no gotten back sooner! It was homecoming week last week and campus has been crazy. I do find tracking helpful because I am able to physically see what I put down and also think about logging problem behaviors which has made me think twice about binging and purging especially learning about he effects and that compensatory behaviors don't really work. My body image is still not good. I am in a new relationship and his ex girlfriend is very critical of me and it's really taken a toll on my self esteem.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I felt sad today about my appearance (I wasn't happy with what I saw in the mirror/clothes), but was able to call my boyfriend to cry about it, and got to hang out with a new friend I made and had a very good night filled with laugh, love, and support. I did not need to eat my feelings away. And for dinner I really focused on eating without distractions and i was able to be in tune with my fullness cues better.

,,,,"I have a question though. I'm looking through the common logical errors our minds make to interpret situations automatically and I want to know what if your assumption turns out to be true? like the person really doesn't like you and thus during conversation they act like they don't want to be there, by checking their phones and not making eye contact ( and you overheard them in another situation badmouthing you).",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,yes yes. so it's more of a tool to decide which thoughts have actual merit and how I can start worrying in a productive way (aka addressing the isse) rather than sitting there and feeling hopeless and aweful,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,yeah. I did today and it was fine. Less than what I expected but trying not to attach feelings to it.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Um, I think that was something that I have already thought about. However, I didn't realize how my success in my career-school was so closely tied with my self esteem. I think because it is not a huge deal now I had kind of forgotten about it. However, I do this that has been an issue in the past. I also realized I guess I have a very narrow idea of what can buffer ones self esteem... it would be cool to work on expanding that",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

It was really hard at first because we were eating really delicious, but high fat/sugar food, but then I went on a little mini holiday with a cousin and ate lots of whole, fresh food and that really changed my perspective. I am realizing more and more how important it is for my emotional well being to eat tasty fresh whole food. It is a bummer that it can be so difficult to find in the states though. Trying to always remember that now and really be more determined to make healthier choices, not so much for the waistline, but for the mind.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,I definitely tend to eat worse and eat more when I am alone and in my room. I feel like I get away with it because no one is watching. I know this is wrong but I don't know how to change this behavior.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Yeah! I usually eat with others. I mostly snack in my room. Sometimes Ill get food and bring it back to my room.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,I've had midterm exams for the last week so I haven't been checking in! Sorry!! Everything's been pretty good!!,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,Hi!! Sorry I've been on break since exams ended and didn't have my computer with me. I just downloaded the new app so I should be back and focused!!,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Neha! Sorry I've been so out of touch! I just got back to school and I'm still getting into the swing of things. 
I think the reason I haven't binged in a while is because I haven't been stressed yet or felt crazy and changing emotions and the feeling of perpetual failure. 
I made it my new years resolution to eat better and focus on myself",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,I want to drink more water and eat healthier and more often,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,I would love to hear what you have in mind for stress regulation exercises!!,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Neha- my schedule is super busy which has helped keep me on track. I have lunch and dinner breaks and I have also been making smoothies for breakfast to start my day off right ( got a magic bullet and I've been really enjoying it). I think my eating is on track. I'm still working on finding time to get to the gym. I know that as school gets harder, it will be more difficult to stay this way, but I'm working on it.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think binge eating came from me doing something to distract myself. Now I try to watch tv and hold a water bottle in my hands. I feel like sometimes I snack because I am bored, if that makes any sense. I have definitely found that eating all my meals with others keeps me from binging. I have a really close friend who I tell everything to, and he even knows I am doing this. He is the only one who knows and is completely supportive of me and pushes me to be my best! I still need to make a workout schedule and commit to it though",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I've been eating a lot healthier and avoiding situations where I could binge like eating alone. I haven't been to stressed.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,I think it would be cool to be able to anonymously talk to others who have similar situations as mine. Or even motivational stories.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Maybe it's because I haven't been doing this everyday.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"dinner! In addition, I think I need to be more conscious of not snacking so much. I find that sometimes I am able to control my meals, and be mindful, but I tend to eat at 9 or 10pm as I'm studying...",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It was ok. Candy is not a thing for me, and I walked the kids around, so I got 3 miles worth of walking, and felt good about that. My legs, back , and hips hurt after and the next day, but it was not too bad. Thank you.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,I'm working on moving toward meal planning. I still can't seem to get past oversized portions and eating past the point where I am physically full. I still watch the amount of food available like a hawk and can't stand the thought that it might be gone but I will want more.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"I'm honestly going through a difficult time right now and may need to delay working on this for the week. My cat has been missing for 4 days and she means the world to me. I want to continue this, but I need this week to continue flyering and searching for my cat.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanksgiving was a little tough, but I'm getting back on my feet today. I've got a week and a half of school/finals before Christmas break, and I'm setting a goal for myself to be productive each of these days. I would love to have a whole week and a half pass without an episode!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks for the advice! I had a counseling session today on campus, and we talked about something similar - the idea of being ok with not being ""perfect."" I do this thing where my mind feels like I have to be perfect, otherwise I just can't do anything. It's an all-or-nothing mentality I'm trying to help myself recognize earlier and avoid when possible. I would really like to talk soon! I'm free tomorrow evening as well as most of the day Sunday. Or I guess you probably only work during the week (sorry, student mentality there!) I'm free Monday morning, most of the afternoon Tuesday, and Wednesday lunch - whatever is best for you!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Kristen, I just want to say thank you for sticking with me. I've been a little out of things this week so far and just couldn't find the motivation to do much of anything, much less start tackling the body image issues I know I struggle with. I have a question for you - I feel like motivation for this kind of stuff requires a lot of energy for me. It is often hard for me to become super motivated about going on a run or not choosing that extra cookie - whatever it may be. Do you have any suggestions for finding this energy, or looking at things in a healthier light such that ""finding the energy"" isn't really a problem? Thank you",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"That middle-centered voice is definitely something I'm trying to develop further! I like me a lot more when I'm that centered, not-extreme person. I've been eating regularly these past few days too, and I feel like my body is slowly settling back down into a normal schedule - I'm feeling hungry again at normal intervals which is nice. On Monday, I'm definitely available from 9-10 a.m. and potentially between 10 and noon. I have an on-campus tutoring job but apparently Monday morning isn't a super popular time - I usually don't get any visitors during my shift! Whatever works best for you is great",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,That sounds great. Hopefully no one comes to my shift tomorrow morning - I'm really looking forward to speaking with you! Have a great rest of the weekend.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I?ve had these setback moments before, and it?s always a gradual process, getting back to a place where I?m happy again and moving forward. Yesterday started out like that - I was grumpy and not motivated in the least. But I actually managed to have a pretty good day! Writing in my lantern tracking program really helped a lot. It felt nice to just get all those thoughts out there. Perhaps this is just me being optimistic, but I feel like I am recovering from this episode faster than I would have in the past! I think that?s something to be thankful for as well.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"As far as whom I might talk to, I would like to have it be someone on campus - someone who I can talk to when things get rough at school. I think I?d like to tell Antonio. He and I actually started dating earlier this quarter, but we had a really cool moment last week when we realized that we really care for each other, but not romantically, if that makes any sense. He is still an amazing friend of mine, and we are so similar in so many ways! He feels like a brother to me. The nice thing is he always makes himself available for conversation, and he is really good at asking those questions I am afraid to ask myself.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I love that you brought up grey areas. Something I've been talking to my counselor a lot is my tendency to categorize things as black and white - I tend toward extremes, especially with food, exercise, and stress. I practiced living in the grey a little bit tonight at dinner - I ate what I knew would satisfy my body, but also took a small portion of something I knew would satisfy my palate.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yeah that feels great. I think I could even use that as a bit of motivation - I could remind myself in those moments that though it's probably not a good idea to have any of whatever food it is that I know might trigger me, I get to have some the next day over lunch or as a snack. It could be something to look forward to in a way. That way I'm not saying ""no"" to whatever food it is, but I'm just saying ""not now."" I think that's a really helpful mentality to have because then I'm not reinforcing that black-and-white perspective I tend to get in",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I just want to make sure that I don't have a super skewed view about what is actually satisfying me and what is not. When I just eat for health, things get a little boring a few days in and that's definitely something I've noticed can lead into a binge. I don't think it's the main cause (I would hazard that stress is still the main player) but it's definitely part of the puzzle.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"After the meal I was definitely full, but it was that ""I know I'm probably going to get hungry later in the night"" kind-of-full. I felt like I ate a very reasonable amount of food for my activity level during the day. Now that I'm thinking back on it more objectively, I don't feel like I was deprived at all. Perhaps I could have made slightly different choices at dinner time that would have left me more satisfied, but I also know that those choices wouldn't have been quite as healthy.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I struggle a bit with the idea of ""off-limit"" foods because, for the most part, the only foods I put off-limit for myself are my trigger foods. Often, it's not even so much what the food itself is exactly, but if it's late at night, I'm stressed, and the food is sweet or full of carbs ... well ... in those situations I try to immediately tell myself that whatever the food is, it's off limits. I feel like that might be another self-constructed extreme though - telling myself that I can absolutely not have whatever it is just because it is likely to make me binge. Do you have any suggestions about how to re-frame my thoughts in those often stressful late-night moments?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"So instead? I'm going to try to let myself not necessarily feel motivated all the time, but to still keep trying and working on this stuff because I want to, and I know it is what I'm meant to be doing right now in my life. That was a really long post (please don't feel like you have to respond to it all!) but it's just really helpful to share these things a bit. I can't wait to tell someone else about this reframing too!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Kristen! I hope you're doing well :) Yeah, it's been a while since I last signed in, and it's something I'm a little sad about. I missed the routine of it, the learning opportunities, and our conversations! But I'm back, and that's something I'm really happy about. Last week was really tough on me, and things have been pretty non-stop until just yesterday. I finally finished my last midterm of the quarter, and things are settling down. I definitely didn't do ""great"" under all the pressure (I had a pretty intense binge eating episode this past weekend that took a while to recover from, physically but also in confidence and mood) but I didn't do so ""bad"" either.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It's a little startling to think about, but if I were to imagine myself handling the stresses of last week oh maybe 6 months ago when my disorder really felt out of hand ... well I can't even imagine how hard that would have been! I think, compared to even the beginning of this quarter, I am doing so much better! I still struggle daily with moments of low body image and low self-esteem, but I'm learning so much about myself! I met with my counselor again today, and it was really great to see myself talking during more of the session than I used to - sometimes now, I'm able to anticipate what she's going to say, or I'm even able to self-diagnose a bit. It's a really great feeling.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm a bit under the weather right now, but other than that, I'm feeling very well and very at peace with things. I think I've been putting too much pressure on myself to be motivated about all things, including tackling my binge eating and body image ""problems,"" but I'm trying to do a bit of a reframe - it doesn't really matter whether I'm motivated or not, I'm learning and growing everyday no matter how excited or inspired I am! It's been a little difficult, only feeling like I'm able to work on my binge eating and body image when I'm actively motivated to do so. I can only be motivated for so long ... it's another one of those extremes I tend toward: extreme motivation vs. a complete inability to tackle those bigger issues at hand.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm going to head off to bed early tonight (yay!) and I'm planning to go on a nice hike tomorrow with a few friends from the dorm - I don't think it will be too taxing physically and I'm excited to get to know them all better! I think the hike will be really restorative mentally, but I also want to make sure that I give myself plenty of rest this weekend. I'm going to take it easy on myself Saturday evening and Sunday as well - I've got a bit of homework to do still, but I'm not going to beat myself up over it. I also get to skype my parents on Sunday, so I'm excited about that! Do you have any other suggestions about how I can ""treat"" myself to something restorative this weekend?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also, I hope you're having a wonderful holiday season! I'm so thankful for your presence in my life - you're really making a difference, and I appreciate all that you do for me and everyone else like me. God bless.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes, we just got off for the holidays! I'm very glad to be done with school for just a little while, take a nice break. Thank you for being so available! I think I'm struggling a bit to keep myself on track with lantern - I was doing so well in the beginning about logging on and completing lessons, but I haven't been well disciplined about it since. I guess I'm looking for ways to be better about it since I know it really is something that is helping me, and something that I find solace in. Maybe logging in at a specific time each day? Or maybe making a promise to myself to log in every time I check facebook or email?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I just weighed myself for the first time since summer. To be honest, it makes me feel a little depressed. I weigh more than I ever have before and I weigh quite a bit more than I did at the beginning of this quarter. I'm trying to view this as a platform for my own improvement in the future, but that's not super helpful right now. Do you have any suggestions about how I might look at this differently? How I can view this less as a failure?",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Tell me if this sounds like a judgmental behavior to you, but I've been trying on a new technique for size. Over the past day or two, I've been asking myself, ""will this make me a better person?"" when I'm confronted by spare time, a plate full of food, or a class to go to. The answer to that question seems a lot easier to deal with than the answer to, ""do I want to?""",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I agree! I think I'll continue to weigh myself maybe once a week or twice a month or something, but I'm going to try not to focus on the results as a measure of my success/failure. I haven't weighed myself since summer and it sometimes felt a little scary to have no idea where I was at - I think weighing myself on occasion might help me alleviate the fear of not knowing, while also preventing me from getting too obsessed over numbers. Does that sound reasonable?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yeah thanksgiving break was a little rough, and I'm really trying to avoid a situation where winter break (which is a whole three weeks for us!) becomes something similar. This week I'm focusing on discipline - I feel like I lost a lot of my personal discipline in the transition from high school to college, and my eating disorder is a prime example. I often feel like I no longer have the will power or self discipline to reign in my own eating urges! I'm giving a lot of this to God - just asking him to give me the strength and motivation to do the things I know are good for me. I feel like that's been a big part of it for me - I know binge eating isn't good for me, and the behaviors that surround it are clearly detrimental to my own happiness, yet I continue to do it! This week I'm just trying to rely on God instead of myself for guidance on what is and isn't good for me, this way when I say no to a binge or say yes to homework or exercise, it's something not entirely under my own control.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yeah, that sounds like a very reasonable and doable suggestion! In that case, I think I should just take some time to more clearly flush out exactly what my goals are for day to day living and for my self esteem. I actually think that the way I've been using ""will this make me a better person"" is more akin to ""is this an action that the ideal Daisy would take?"" I think, with either mode of questioning, I'll just have to be mindful of being loving and accepting toward myself if (and when) I do take actions that are not ""better"" or are not moving me toward my goals.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I've also been doing a reasonably good job of keeping up the ""is this what ideal Daisy would do"" line of questioning these past two days. I've definitely had moments where the answer is no, and moments where I've forgotten to even consider the question. Even with these moments of lapse, I haven't been beating myself up about it, which I'm very happy about! I think I'm learning what my limits are. I've always been one to push myself with work and school and extracurriculars, but I'm realizing that I am not the all-present, all-capable person I would love to be. And that's ok! Ideal Daisy doesn't have to be literally God-like in her abilities, she can just be the most she's capable of being. Sometimes that is a great deal, and sometimes it's not.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"There's something else I've started doing this week that I feel is really helping me to appreciate the progress I'm making - I've started a little learning journal of sorts. Either late at night before bed, or at some point the next day, I'll reflect on my day and how it went, and I'll try to take away one or two little learning messages. I've found it really helpful this week to glance over my list of learnings, and just think about how I learned them - the messages are starting to really sink in!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Those sound like awesome suggestions about the chocolate - I actually had a moment today after lunch where I was craving something a bit sweet and I thought about breaking off a square. I realized though that I was in kind of a stressed mood and that I was needing to go to class soon. I decided not to have the chocolate because I was a bit stressed and knew I wouldn't enjoy it like I wanted to - I didn't realize this until just now, but I think I made a really smart mindful decision! Success for the day :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm feeling alright about finals. I have one take home that looks really nasty, and only one concrete final next week. I'm feeling significantly less stressed about testing this quarter than I have in quarters past. That said, I'm also very excited to say that I'm dealing with finals stress better this quarter than I ever have at Stanford! Usually, dead week and finals week are the most challenging for me, and are the weeks during which I binge the most. I haven't binged once yet so far this time around, so that's a major positive.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Kristen! I'm back at home now, and all settled in for the break! But going back to finals week ... I didn't do as good a job of taking mini-breaks as I would have liked. I spent hours and hours on end just studying at my desk, which was rather joyless. I KNEW that going on a run now, or taking a shower break then, or planning a night out later, would be good things for me, but I just couldn't pull myself away from my work. I binged over the weekend which didn't make my Monday final any easier, but I ended up doing really well on the test anyways. Considering the amount of stress I was under, I actually think I did a pretty good job of managing myself, at least in comparison to quarters past :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm taking three different kinds of wellness courses this quarter (a class called yoga for stress management, a class on meditation, and a course called resilience). I feel very well supported both at school and at home, and I'm looking forward to a quarter full of growth and learning :)",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Kristen, I hope you've been well :) Sorry for not keeping in better touch over the break!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

,,,,"That said, I don't think I am going to be continuing on with the lantern program. I found a lot of it very helpful, and with your guidance I think I've reached a new stage in my treatment process - a stage I think other treatment measures might be better suited. I will definitely reach out to you if I feel like I need some extra support in the future, but for now I think I'd like to practice applying some of the techniques lantern taught me in real life.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I can't wait to get back on track. Obviously Monday has passed but I could do Thursday!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Well Im nervous... I haven't actually weighed myself in a long time because I am afraid of what I might find.

I've been thinking though, since I've been logging my food pretty much daily since May, I'm thinking I might take a break from it.

,,,,"Hi Neha! I totally understand what you're saying. I actually eat quite regularly when I diet, but I just restrict on calories, so that's why I am afraid to plan my meals because I normally eat when I'm hungry (every couple of hours) and like to go by that instead of pre planning when I should eat my calories.

,,,,"To better word what I was trying to say in the call, my biggest goal is to just stop making food such a huge part of my life. A binge might take 15 mins, but the effects of it last hours to days. Purging takes even longer. Thinking about food, planning meals, watching what I eat in comparison to friends, etc., that just all takes so much time and causes so much stress... and no matter what I do, I'm still gaining weight here. I'm seeing numbers on the scale that I never have before, and that's so scary. I'm a ballet dancer, so body size/image matters a lot.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

Would appreciate any personalized tips for this!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I've found that it really helps to eat in restaurants, so I feel that my meals are ""complete"" and portions are set for me. At home or in a dining hall, I have such a variety of food options that I want to try them all and never get full until I've gone through a sandwich, a bar of chocolate, and two rolls of crackers (this happened to me today). The worst part is that the insulin spike (?) causes me to be lethargic for the rest of the day. Feeling hopeful for tomorrow though.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

Today's was, after a normal sandwich (I was stuffed), having a bag of pretzels and unhealthy granola bar. Still the same out of control feeling, but I was able to stop myself sooner. Hoping for more progress! If I don't buy unhealthy food, I tend to not want to eat it. I also like to choose healthy meals anyway, but it's desserts/snacks that really get me.

I'm trying a new app that prompts me to take pictures of everything I eat, which will keep me accountable for binges. I only ever feel the need to purge when I binge. Hoping I can stop this soon, and if not, I'll call Stanford CAPS when I'm back on campus after break. Thank you!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I've started using another diet tracking app that simply has me take a picture of whatever I eat. Just by thinking, ""do I really want to put this in my body?"" for a second before eating really helps. Because of it, I hadn't binged/purged in 4 days!! Today we went to a buffet, though, and I overate so I did throw up a little. Still hard to resist, but getting better. I've also noticed some facial swelling going down since I stopped throwing up every day.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I just thought of how silly it was -- I know that I only want to throw up when I overeat, so I thought of all the time and pain I'd have to waste for that extra granola bar or bag of chips.

,,,,"Merry belated Christmas, Kristen! I just wanted to say thank you for all your support these past few months. Having someone to talk to about this has been so, so helpful. I haven't told anyone else. Your advice and this program have been amazing. Over the past two weeks of winter break, I've been on vacation, surrounded by family and love, and with access to fresh food (in Hawaii). As a result, I've lost 8 of the pounds I gained over the semester while eating regularly, and I'm very happy. I've only thrown up twice in the past two weeks and only binged maybe 5 times. I still have trouble with unhealthy food -- if it's there, I can't resist. But I'm working on not punishing myself for it too much (maybe with exercise instead of throwing up), and choosing healthy food over unhealthy (salads at restaurants instead of the burger I would normally love). It's been hard and I'm not quite there yet -- food still takes up a lot of my headspace. But it's getting a lot better! Thank you and best wishes for the holidays!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

,,,,Hi Kristen! Sorry I haven't been tracking as much recently as school has picked back up. I still have a hard time eating regularly (I LOVE food and think about it way too often...) but I've only thrown up once in the past week!

In general, I do worse in the evening. Already a huge improvement though!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I don't even think twice before grabbing a huge plateful of dessert or bag of chips... until afterwards. I've thrown up the past few days but I refuse to tonight.

Anything is fine for lunch, but after dinner, if I dont immediately leave after my first plate, I end up having 2 or 3 more small portions of cake, cereal, chicken, bread and peanut butter, etc. -- whatever is available. I don't understand because I do eat regular sized meals. Exercise makes no difference on my appetite. Just struggling with self-control in the evening.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I have not meditated yet, but the social situations have helped, especially since I eat with friends who are also working on their health or slow eaters. I'm working on eating slowly and mindfully with them, since I tend to take big bites... and then feel hungry even when I should be full! Got an app to meditate. Will try it for the first time today!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Kristen! Sorry that I have been inactive -- things have been busy. But I've been eating so much better lately! I still binge occasionally but have only thrown up maybe 2 times in the past week. I have started to genuinely enjoy eating fresh foods (vegatables, fruits, lean meats) and am doing a lot better. Somehow I'm even losing weight (I was gaining weight while bulimic). Very happy. Still working though.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Talking to you has made a huge difference since I can't really confide in anyone else! How can I fully understand what healthy eating is? I can eat a salad, I can say no to a cookie, but given new environments and foods, I don't know how to approach portion sizes, meal frequency, etc. Currently, I usually eat 2 meals a day (lunch around 12 and dinner around 5 or 6). Do not like or have time for eating breakfast, usually -- I wake up pretty late anyway. One of my big problems is late night eating, but it's sometimes necessary because I'm up late. I also have a huge weakness for desserts and over-portioning!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My goals are less to get over disordered eating/vomiting (as I have better control over this -- I still ""binge"" but in the same ways that other friends do, as in maybe having two cookies with breakfast vs. how I used to buy food from every restaurant in the plaza). I think that I am looking to get better body image and eat healthier in general. It's hard for me to know how to eat right and I definitely still am insecure... lots better though.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks Kristen. I do think that I struggle with the ""good"" and ""bad"" divide, mostly because if I let myself have some unhealthy food, I tend to go overboard and eat huge portions. I love eating salads, but then I'll want a croissant and another sandwich and maybe a parfait afterwards. None of these are inherently horrible foods, but I just think about food way too often and end up eating to the point where I feel sick and have to either throw up or sleep it off. As I said, it's been better lately, but I'm worried about a ""slip becoming a slide"" as you said...",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"After eating the wrap, I went to the bathroom and considered throwing up, but I resisted (win!) and went to work out instead. I really want to get better. I'm at least being more conscious about my actions. Still difficult though. Relapsed a bit this weekend.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"For example, this morning I woke up early with the intention to get work done. I grabbed breakfast at my dining hall (totally normal breakfast), but as I walked past a cafe on the way to the library, I couldn't resist buying another meal-sized wrap. Ate the whole thing, felt tired and sick (that was, what, 1000+ calories within an hour of waking up?), went back to my dorm to sleep it off the whole day. It's now 5:40pm and the last time I ate was 10:30am. I'm considering skipping dinner because I feel bloated and my thighs definitely feel thicker than they did last week. I know I should eat, but it feels dangerous to start eating if I don't know how to stop.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Kristen, thank you for being so supportive! You have no idea how much difference it makes to just talk to someone. :) This week has been better. I did binge two days in a row when I had pastries and chocolate in my room (gifts from parents when they visited), felt terrible, and threw up one of the days. But now that there are no snacks in my room, I've been pretty good about not bingeing. I've also been working out every day, which is hugely helping my body image. I still struggle to understand what ""healthy"" eating is on the whole (yes one salad is healthy, but what does one healthy day look like?) and, for example, skipped dinner on one day because I felt that I had eaten too much earlier. Overall habits are better though. Yesterday was pretty normal.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Kristen, it's finals week so yes I've been very stressed -- thanks for asking! I've been falling off my exercise routine for the past four days and have thrown up a couple times to make up for really bad eating habits. I think once the anxiety/busyness dies down it will be better. Gaining a little bit of weight but it'll go away once I stop stress eating!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes, a lot. I find that I'm a lot happier mentally and socially but maybe less focused academically? But I really want to get back into routine.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hmm... with finals week it has been all over the place. As I would get up early to study, I'd have breakfast (which I normally don't), which I would often eat way too much for (then still eat regularly for lunch). Night time is definitely my worst -- very prone to late night cravings. I also cannot resist dessert for my life, and I know that adds up a lot of empty calories. Maybe I should try to keep healthier snacks on hand.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you for asking! Also, to answer your question of what ""normal"" eating would be (from a few weeks ago... thought that was great food for thought), I would say my ideal ""healthy"" day in college would be: 

wake up around 9:30
work out
shower and get dressed, do work/go to class
have lunch (salad with chicken, maybe a sandwich, some fruit) around 12
classes/work
have dinner around 6 (similar foods as for lunch. emphasis on fresh food and few carbs/processed things)
spend the rest of the night working/relaxing attending meetings

ideally there would be no snacks except for fruit, a granola bar, etc. However, a real day often looks like 2 much unhealthier meals plus a lot of late night snacking, maybe not as much working out, pretty much always dessert... etc. I just think about food too often",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"The negative thoughts are such an integrated part of my life... I don't know. I've tried to be more vocal about them and find that many friends share similar thoughts. I always feel bad after I eat a lot and have a hard time controlling myself. Objectively I know my body looks fine, it's just tough for me to eat so badly because I know I will gain weight. It's like I'm in a haze while I'm eating, then feel immediately guilty afterwards.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I'm going to work on that. The mindfulness exercise today was a huge help. I was feeling really nervous and was about to go eat even though I'm not hungry, but I'm feeling way more collected and happy now.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,I also think I'm seeing the negative effects of vomiting since I've had digestive issues. So I am at least forcing myself not to do that.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It was fine. Didn't eat too much. Also had success for lunch today -- I looked at the dining hall menu before going and was able to plan a healthy meal (salad with curry, fruit, small piece of dessert) beforehand so I wasn't tempted by other options that I normally grab on a whim (pita bread, sandwiches, yogurt parfaits, etc.). Overall a good meal!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Coming up with the balanced thoughts was not difficult but I do need to be reminded to do it in my daily life. Such a useful exercise. Threw up yesterday and feeling a bit insecure about my body again but I think it's getting better. Eating well isn't too difficult most of the time.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

I'd be happy to talk with you by phone if that's still something you'd like to set up. Thanks,

,,,,"Ok sounds good. I think I'm struggling to distinguish a binge from impulsive eating. A couple nights ago I felt like I couldn't just have one serving at dinner or one dessert. I felt a lack of control over my eating. This doesn't compare to what my binges and purges were like months ago. I have more difficulty now with eating mindfulness or feeling like I have the power to make healthy decisions about food. As far as resetting, I just try not to beat myself feel badly after an episode of uncontrollable eating.",,,,,none,,,,,,,,
,,,,The meal tracking has been helpful. I've been visiting family the last couple weeks so it's been easier to eat meals with people that are flexible and satisfying. My challenge will be continuing to do this once I'm back at my place and eating more meals on my own. This is when I tend to have more self criticism with food and a fear of gaining weight. I can give you a call at 12:45pm tomorrow if that works.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Kristen, yes I feel more vulnerable to them when I'm alone. They are definitely linked to my emotions as well. I'm also not in the best living situation right now which is contributing to the stress and making me want to spend more time in my room. I'm moving in about a month so this is temporary. I also tend to get really strong cravings at night.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Kristen, that night I was feeling rejected because my plans w/someone fell through. I was feeling lonely, especially after an intense day at work.

I'm also trying to get up earlier so I can have a mindful breakfast instead of eating on the go. The restricted dinner was after I ate a big lunch provided by my work. I also got home from work late. I felt hungry and tired when I got home. I ended up picking sleep over dinner. However, I may have been compensating for overeating during lunch.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Maybe some deep breathing, calling a friend, or going outside for a few minutes. I was feeling really down and binged again yesterday. I feel like it was avoidable, but felt powerless in the moment. I was feeling anxious about school starting again. I got some support from my therapist today and will be practicing DBT skills to avoid binging.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

This was helpful because I noticed I wasn't really taking breaks. Part of the issue at work with eating is some days I just snack throughout the day instead of taking a lunch. I do want to make a point of actually going to our break room and eating with others more often.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,Thank you! So far so good. I have been more flexible with eating and trying to plan ahead when I know I'll have long days. I've gained a little weight since I stopped binging and purging so I'm working on getting more comfortable with how I look. I realize this is the weight my body wants me to be. When I weighed less it didn't make me happy and I was unhealthy. Practicing daily acceptance of this is the challenging part now.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Trying to do nice things for myself on days when I feel self critical or have low self esteem. I think keeping busy helps because then I have less time to be in my head.,,,,,none,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think the technique has been working okay so far. It's kind of difficult to ""make"" myself have a snack when I don't feel like I'm hungry enough to the point where I would normally eat but by the end of the day I'm more satisfied and feel less inclined to eat something I feel I ""shouldn't"" or binge. I wanted to reduce my tendency to swing between not eating enough and binging and this technique seemed like a good one for that purpose. For the phone call, I can do between 9 AM and 9:45 AM PST on Wednesday or Friday or Monday after 2:30 PST. Let me know what works for you.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Liz-it was great to talk to you as well! I am willing to implement self-care behaviors...I think something I might be willing to implement is to do something caring for myself/my body like paint my nails, take a bath, or put on some scented lotion...or maybe do something small and relaxing like read a few pages of a book for pleasure.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I really did like the deep breathing! I'll definitely utilize that when I'm feeling really stressed next. I think I'm fairly comfortable reaching out to friends for support, but only one, maybe two. I have difficulty sometimes reaching out to friends that I feel like won't ""get it"" or may react in a way that's not helpful. For the most part I still sometimes feel that way even with the person/people I trust-but I reach out anyway in hopes that they'll be helpful.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Thanks for the input-I'll keep it in mind next time I'm reaching out to a friend :),,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,I'm thinking afternoons would be best. I'll definitely start with every other day and hopefully work back up to every day. Sorry again for not participating really regularly-I'm working on it though!,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I wasn't totally surprised to learn about the eating myths-I've done a fair amount of research about weight loss and etc. I was surprised to learn about the ""one meal a day""-I always assumed if your ""net"" calories (consumed - used) were below a certain limit, you would lose weight regardless. I wasn't aware of how much truth the ""survival mode"" of a person's metabolism really held, but it was a good amount!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Liz! So I started thinking about my roommate-maybe some of our relationship/why I enjoy being her friend revolves around her intelligence, and beauty and creativity are honestly not part of the foundation of our friendship. That being said, it definitely wouldn't change our relationship drastically if she wasn't as smart, beautiful, or creative...it's difficult to hold myself to high standards because I don't often feel proud or accomplished. I either meet my standards and feel okay or I don't and feel disappointed and frustrated. Evaluating that and trying to be objective, it makes me feel that I could cut myself some more slack and give myself some more credit for trying.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think I will try to make sure I am eating regularly the one or two days leading up to it to have a sort of ""pattern"" to follow, or like a good streak to ride through. I also will try to be mindful when I am eating, and enjoy the food . If I am feeling particularly bad I will probably do some of the 4/7/8 breathing as well.",,,,,none,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you for the encouragement! I do have plans for Thanksgiving-I will be going to my parents' house and some other family will be there. I'm always somewhat concerned eating in front of my family, especially my mom. It will be difficult to try and eat an appropriate amount, not restricting or just all-out binging. I am going to make some food myself so hopefully that will help, as I know I'll have at least one healthy option on my plate. It is also tricky because I'm a vegetarian and carb-heavy food is one of the things that can trigger unhealthy eating patterns for me.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Thanks so much for the advice Liz-I will definitely try some is these techniques. I hope you have a good Thanksgiving too!,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi Liz! I have done two of the exposure activities. I was fairly nervous about them but they have been pretty okay so far. I did one alone and one with a supportive friend. I definitely had to push myself to be mindful while eating.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you so much for the encouragement! So I did the donut exercise and also the one with bread, which was the food lowest on the list. I still need to do my #3 food and my #1 food. I am not too anxious about my #3 food, considering how the other two went. I am pretty anxious about my #1 food-regular soda. I'm going to try and do the exercise when I'm eating a meal with a friend and hope that they will help provide some support.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Liz! The exposure activities are going well. The main issue I'm running into lately is when I eat an appropriately-sized meal, I sometimes will feel uncomfortable with being a normal amount of full. I have been trying to just ""tough it out"" for lack of a better term but I was wondering if you had any advice? 

Otherwise, I am feeling pretty good about my goals. I think my eating has really balanced out lately and my body image is slowly but surely feeling better, at least partially because I feel a little more in control of my eating. Some days are tougher than others, but I definitely already feel healthier.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks for the tip, Liz! I'll let you know how it is next time I feel this way.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes, we are definitely working on it! It's difficult but I'm putting a lot of effort in and I have faith that it will eventually improve. In the meantime, I do like the mindfulness practices and I am hoping to incorporate them into my daily routine a little more.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Liz! So I've definitely just been experiencing high levels of anxiety overall, which I am partially addressing in counseling, but is definitely also related to food. Somtimes when I'm particularly overwhelmed or my anxiety is affecting my sleep schedule I will feel particularly anxious or irritated. This can also, for me, come out in the form of feeling almost paralyzed by indecision about food-feeling like I need to eat healthy but still meet my meals and snacks, and wanting to eat foods I enjoy that are not always healthy but not to set off a binge or spiral into negative thinking. Also, the mindfulness went fairly well! I think with practice it will get easier.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I definitely feel that shape checking leads me to more directly feel negative about my body and feeds into my anxiety or stress overall. I also think that I tend to avoid when I'm feeling vulnerable but avoiding actually just makes me feel worse instead of helping anything feel better.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks Liz! It's definitely been tough but worth it. The holiday season is fairly stressful for me so far. Like Thanksgiving, I'm going home (but this time for about 10 days) and I anticipate it will be high-stress emotionally and probably in a food-related way too. I'm a little concerned about binging or about the restricted eating I've been struggling with more recently rearing its ugly head-like feeling uncomfortable when I'm full, having no or little appetite or ignoring my appetite, going long hours without eating, etc.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Liz! thanks so much for the advice-I do think working to stick to my three meals and snacks will be helpful, especially since I've been straying from that a bit lately. I am definitely working to get back on track!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My schedule is a little erratic being at home, both in terms of sleeping and in terms of just generally doing things. That kind of throws a wrench into my eating. Being around my family is also tough because they're very judgemental about what I eat.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Thanks Liz! Luckily I'm only here for a few more days. And I've been able to get back into a schedule of exercising which has been helpful.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks Liz! Same to you :) and to answer your earlier question, the cognitive reframing has been helpful so far!",,,,,none,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you Liz! I actually wanted to ask your advice about something-I'm in a new (short-term) work environment with some people who are really toxic about food. Most of my friends have been supportive as I've been moving along on my journey to get to a healthy place, so I've all but removed food negativity from my life-at least on a daily basis, from my close friends/support group. My coworkers, however, are constantly talking about dieting, losing weight, weighing themselves....even when they're all conventionally thin and attractive. I don't feel comfortable enough to share that I'm in a tough place with food, and my attempts to change the subject or get them to disengage are not helpful. Any suggestions?",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Liz! Sorry I haven't been answering a whole ton. I've been on a week-long leadership retreat. I was able to practice some relaxation skills with my coworkers, like deep breathing. Also, I seriously can't believe I've been doing the program for 70 days! While I still have my ups and downs, I do feel my body image is better overall, and for the most part I feel more grounded with my eating",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Liz! So part of it was definitely that I had the retreat, but I've also been struggling a little bit with lowered mood and motivation. I have been talking to my therapist about it, though. I'm going to try and set a time to set aside every day to do my HBI work-I've definitely been letting it fall by the wayside a little.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It kind of made me feel the same. Some of other times I've tried this technique it has helped me feel better, but sometimes it doesn't make a difference at all. I do see the benefit in working through my automatic thoughts, though. Even if I don't necessarily believe the more balanced versions of them right now.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Liz-thanks for the encouragement :) I've been working on trying to positively reframe my situation as much as I am able to reduce stress-for example, working to give myself breaks when I feel that I need them, constantly reinforcing that I can take my schoolwork one day and assignment at a time, etc. And I did really like the ""dealing with setbacks"" session-it helped me feel a little more reassured, as some of my restrictive behaviors are pretty ""stubborn"", and have emerged more prominently in the last few weeks.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I definitely think my stress has been a trigger for me in struggling to eat regularly and do the 3 meals and 2 snacks. However, I will say I've been actively working on listening to my body and making sure that I am full and not leaving myself deprived, which I tend to do. I've started classes at my university again, so I'm hoping a regular schedule with help with the reinforcement of an eating schedule as well.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Liz! Yes, it has been hectic! I haven't hit any specific boundaries but I appreciate you asking about it. I definitely will use, and have used the 4-7-8 breathing technique. I've also been trying to eat intuitively and try to stop avoiding my body in mirrors, etc. automatic thought identification has also been helpful for me.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Liz! In general, breaking the chain is harder for me, but it definitely has been a little easier every time I try it. The urges to binge and restrict are really becoming more manageable in an everyday sense",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Liz! That's ok :) this week has been pretty good, honestly! Busy but good. In general I find that I'm having an easier time intuitively eating and body image-wise, everything feels easier or at the very least less overwhelming. I'm feeling like the work I've put in with HBI is paying off :)",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Liz! The sleep relaxation technique is honestly great. It works really well for me when I'm too anxious to calm down and sleep. I've been using the techniques, like cognitive reframing, even when I'm not necessarily using them in the Lantern app. Overall, things are tough but my eating and body image has felt fairly stable which is really good :)",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Liz! I definitely am. Things have been fairly stressful lately, especially with my roommate. I do think that there is a realistic possibility of these things happening. We have been fighting and she has been avoiding me. However, I still have other friends that are here for me and having some distance between a friend and I is not the end of the world, if it's what will ultimately help me be healthy.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

My ideal weight is around 120lbs, and the lowest weight I have gotten to is around 125lbs.

I'm currently an MBA1 student and I have been long struggling with body image and weight. I grew up in South Korea where there is a even worse stigma on being overweight. I was too scrawny and short up until I was five so my mom tried various kinds of medication and supplements and I started gaining weight and was on the chubbier side ever since. That's when all the negative social pressure started flooding in. Random strangers, distant family, school teachers all told me to lose weight and my nickname was always tied to my weight. I never developed anorexia or bulimia but my self esteem suffered and it actually made it harder for me to diet. I tried 20+ different diets, some worked temporarily but eventually I failed every time.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

In the past month or so, I cained nearly 10 lbs, and I am very concerned.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,Hi Kristen I got too busy and stressed with finals so I didnt have much time or energy for HBI. I'd say I did some moderate binging (~3000-4000 calories on a stressed day) I plan to start/try arts and crafts to build a hobby I can focus on and keep mind off food.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

Right now my body weight is at about 139lbs, the lower end of my usual weight as it fluctuates between 135 - 145, more on the 140-145 side. I'm not super eager to lose weight, I feel pretty confident and positive about my body around this range although being 130lbs would be great.

I am maintaining the same weight for about 2-3weeks now and it feels great! I also didn't have much stressful episodes so that could be another factor. Also now when I do feel stressed I turn to mindful meditation. I hope I can maintain this up to midterms interviews and finals. The guy I was dating didn't work out but luckily it did not have any negative repurcussions on my eating habits or body image.

Up until college, I have been self-motivated to get A's, my parents never had to tell me study or get a certain grade. I had been a straight A student and valedictorian in high school. In college, as my parents phrase it, I got ""distracted"" or ""lost my focus"", which describes how my first B's turned into first C's and D's and A's became rare. Even though I graduated from a great university, I don't feel the same sense of accomplishment like in high school because I didn't earn any academic honors.

Thanks for still checking on me. I want to apologize for some of the delayed response (this time) as several of your messages were in my clutter folder. Things are still going really well (amazingly). I have been really keeping my portions in control and eating balanced meals. I think the biggest change has been quitting drinking Dr. Pepper (well, all soda, really). In keeping track/being more mindful I noticed how it was almost a trigger for my bad eating. Plus, I think it would have to add to my sugar cravings (which I really am no longer having--but it was a painful first week). Again, without really trying anything other than being mindful of what I am putting into my body, I have now sustained a 10 lb. weight loss. I have been most excited to get through the emotion regulation path as I feel my eating patterns are strongly tied to emotions. Cheers, Laura",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

There have been areas that have not worked fully as they were supposed to, but I am pretty sure I let you know when those were encountered. As far as the tracking tool, I switched back to myfitnesspal tracker fairly early in the program due to not being able to alter inputs.

I'm still curious about the Dear Body exercise you mentioned?I'd like to try it. 
I really liked the opposite action exercise! I was invited to go rock climbing with some friends. I'm pretty terrified of heights and generally get nervous up there because I feel like I'm weak or something. I decided to go and go all out and it was a lot of fun. So much for anxiety!

Sometimes that proves too much for me, but overall that practice has been effective.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"I think that a lot of that has to do with an improved relationship with the food I eat. I used to use food as a type of therapy, and I do that a lot less now. I think that is a big part of it. I'm excited to see how I am able to maintain this mentality.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

It sounds like a silly thing, but I was not taking any time for myself, because of my busy schedule. Being an RA as well, I live at work so it is easy to get wrapped up 24/7. I weighed in earlier and it was 200.8 again. I'm not sure why it went back up, especially since I've started exercising more. Maybe it was Easter? I'm not sure, but hopefully it will reflect the work I've been putting in soon.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you for that information! I have tried some of those other activities as well. Sometimes I feel like I am wasting time if I don't do something productive, so I use my self-care time to do productive things for my studies as well. I have enjoyed the mindfulness.

,,,,"Hey Anna. As I have been working through my eating and self image this summer, I do not feel that I will continue with the program. My time constraints have been huge and I feel that I have gained a lot of info that I have been able to implement already.

Thank you for the reminders, with residents moving in in a few days and classes starting soon as well I think that I will have to stand by my decision to not continue the program. Things have been going well, but busy for sure! Thank you for keeping in touch.

,,,,"Hello Emily! 
I'm excited to be part of the team! So, I have a big problem, a problem that many people go through-- body image and eating disorder (mine is binge eating). 
I am honestly really skeptical that I will get better, but I'm giving HBI, actually, giving myself a chance. Thanks for helping me out.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I worked out Monday and Tuesday. 
I have a question. 
What should I do when I cannot love my body?
I've realized for the past 4 days, I wore the same clothes every day.... I wore yoga pants, a tshirt, and over it, a sweater. 
One day, I wore jeans with a sweater. I don't usually look in the mirror before I leave to school, but when I looked myself in the school mirror, I looked so fat.. 
I know I'm not overweight because I weigh 125 with my height of 5'2. But in my eyes, I was soo fat and I lost my self- confidence for that day. 
I feel like the only solution to this is to lose weight, but is this healthy? Are there other ways, more practical/healthy ways to love my body as of now?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Im well. I eat the pills when i eat like avocados, fish oil, etc.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes, i actually saw Mayyan once but shes unfortunately too busy to see every day.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you. I think other than trying to keep a healthy diet, I need to overcome my body image problems. I constantly compare myself with other people (esp. with celebrities). I know that the images of celebrities that magazines portray are all airbrushed, photoshopped, etc. but I can't help but to compare myself. I think the fact that I'm not at my goal weight stresses me out.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Emily, 
Sorry for being so MIA. I was very busy and was going through some emotional ups and downs. I'm better now, and its spring break so I should be able to be more consistent. So for the past few days, I've been okay with my body image. I mean, its been the same. Surprisingly, I haven't been bingeing for like... 2 weeks? So I am very very happy. However, I still struggle with my body image. I feel so fat and I don't feel like dressing up for anything (same as last time). I feel like whatever I wear will make me look fat and ugly. Thanks for messaging me!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"So I have a question. 
I feel like losing weight it the ONLY way for me to EVER be satisfied with my body image. How I fix this? I want to lose weight soooo desperately, but I feel like no matter what I do-- I will still be the weight I currently am.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yah, 
This is a huge victory for me. I think the mentality of ""eating just a little bit of junk/unhealthy food is okay"" instead of restricting myself completely from the bad foods really helped me. 
Nothing yet, but hopefully, I will find some tools that will help me soon",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes,
I have a roommate who, I think, is very pretty. She is very fit and attractive.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes, I am takin Calorease. Im taking the pill mainly because I want to lose weight. It tells you to eat whenever i consume ""fat."" No, I just eat when Im alone because Im ashamed to eat in front of people. Theres no judgement if Im eating/binging alone",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Im not too sure if Break the Chain is working.. But it definitely has been a good reminder of what i should be doing.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

what about you? do you recommend any?",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

,,,,"yes, i do, but i don't usually like meeting people. I try to avoid it as much as possible.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Emily, i went to a swimsuit store to buy a swimsuit and i came out with nothing but depression. I didnt know i was that fat... It was my first time looking in the mirror with nothing but my undergarments. Im so shocked. Will i ever be able to lose weight and go back to how i looked? People say I should love the way i look but i cannot accept myself.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Ive been much better with binge eating though,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi Emily! Summers been good. My mom is surprisingly really helpful. We had a heart to heart talk about my eating and body image problems.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Im on a road trip right now and I dont have reception or internet most of the time.

I think it was hard for my mom to understand and accept that I have an eating disorder, but she apologized and she told me she will support me. 
I'm actually back from the trip. I ate a lot, but I feel like I didn't binge. I definitely had urges, but I didn't give in entirely (haha).",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"not bad. I've been eating well (meaning-- healthy, good quantity amount of good with no binges). I'm usually okay with binges when im new or getting used to a new environment. so since i've come back to an environment i need to adjust to, i haven't had any cravings, which is good! I'm hoping i could stay like this forever. I feel normal and healthy.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

Maybe I'm just getting better!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,i like grounding and 4-7-8 breathing technique,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Good. 
Emily, It's been 3 weeks since I've binged. I am soooo happy and cannot be ever be more satisfied than this. A lot of it has definitely been through the help of this program. I am beyond thankful.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also, now that I'm not bingeing, I feel much lighter. I think I have also lost some weight although I haven't weighed myself since April 1. I can fit into my pants that used to be very tight on me. 
Therefore, I am much more confident in my body. I still feel like I have ways to go until I am fully satisfied with how I look, but I feel like I am getting closer to that day every single day.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Anyway, I plan to finish this program so that I will permanently stop bingeing.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yah! 
I'm well. I'm so sorry that I haven't been logging in. The truth is-- now I don't binge, I keep forgetting that I have to log in to Lantern. I shall set up an alarm every day. 
Today marks my 4th week NOT bingeing. I am beyond happy. 
This morning, I ate of my forbidden foods, bread, with jelly and banana, and surprising, I didn't binge on it! I didn't think much of it after finishing the sandwich. It is as if I forgot that I've binged on bread. I'm just so glad.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hello! Yes, I'm pretty busy. I'm sorry I haven't been doing the sessions! ):",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,i personally like grounding tools too.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"ive been using the 4-7-8 breathing since day 1
i think that has helped me since i was introduced to it",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes! Thank you for the reminder! I'm doing well. I think binged last week. It had the same urging sensation when I looked for food, but I actually started my period like 2 days after, so I think I was just PMS-ing. It was kinda my first time PMS-ing after I stopped binging. How do i distinguish a PMS from a binge? Also, I don't usually have PMS so I think i'm a little shocked. Any suggestions or recommendations on this?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes! 
Well, whether I was PMS-ing or not, I was always eating so I didn't know the difference....

No, I'm actually doing really really well",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

I actually moved to china a couple of days ago.
life is good right now. sorry i keep forgetting to log in. i just stopped binging completely, so i forget about this. but thanks for the constant messages. i need it.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

I'm doing well. I actually moved to China a month ago and the internet is really slow.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I think I binged for the first time in 5 months. I'm pretty depressed and i dont know what happened. i was so sure that i had overcame my eating disorder,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Thank you! The thing I really want to tackle is the stress eating. When I was younger I was bulimic. I am still using parts of the pattern I used to use to deal with my emotions. Any tips or help you could offer here would be greatly appreciated.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Especially when I am under a lot of stress these patterns come out. I crave sweets when I am stressed and overdo it. Then I feel bad and eat some more. Then I feel really horrible and I start thinking about eating plans and how to make up for it the next day. Although I don't use laxativesome any more, I don't think I ever recovered and I didn't develop healthy coping skills. I am really under a lot of stress and I am at my highest weight ever. I even touched base with my doctor to see if I am a candidate for medically supervised weight loss. I am embarrassed now.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I know all this in my mind, but emotionally it is just wrecking me. I feel so much shame about not being able to manage this....I have wasted so much time, effort, and money because of it. I have lost relationships. I am getting sick of it, and I am tired of hiding. Thanks for listening. I typically don't talk about it, so it's nice to have an outlet. My husband has tried to support me in the past, but he just doesn't get it.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I wanted to ask you something. My weight is at an unhealthy (My doctor is concerned). I am unsure of how to reach a healthy weight if I am not supposed to be dieting, or restricting calories. ? I do know that any diet I do will not work until I work through my emotional issues around food. Where to start?",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I do have the logical errors especially when I am not feeling good about myself. 

Socially I am doing better. I had to force myself in the beginning to go to social functions. I felt better after which encourageday me to continue.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think it's the difference between what I know to be true in my head and what I feel emotionally. Plus food, weight loss, and exercise take up a lot of energy.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Yes. I am placing a lot of time and effort on food and dieting. Perhaps because I feel like I have little control over other aspects of my life.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I have thought about it, but I don't know what that would look like. I have been dieting and counting calories since I was 10. I am not sure how to start. I do know where I get tripped up though. I start a diet plan and I go along good until I go off plan, overeat/emotionally eat. Then I decide, well since I already screwed it up I might as well make it count. So that's where the binge begins. Then I have post-binge remorse and I resolve to take control of my food the next day. Do you have any suggestions?",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,BTW I don't really remember not being on a diet or being calorie conscious,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"A concern I have about ""normal eating"" is that I would eat too many calories. I also think eating 5 times a day would be too much, but could do 4. I don't think I could stop counting calories.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I like Bob Harper's Skinny rules book. It's very structured and provides meal options for each meal; it is healthy and balanced but calorie restricted. Women eat 1200 calories and men eat 1500 calories (I usually shoot for the 1500 cals tho). I have also tried weightloss websites such as jillian michaels, carb cycling, even weight watchers. I have done well with the skinny rules program, but I get tripped up when I go off plan or stress eat.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I have been busy. I also tried to ""eat normal,"" and I gained about 10 pounds. Not sure if it will work for me.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"No. I was pretty much just eating whatever foods I felt like eating, without consideration for health. I know it probably sounds crazy but I really don't know what normal eating looks like, and what constructing a normal eating plan would look like.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna. Thanks for taking the time on Friday to talk. I am forcing myself to go out after our talk, and it seems to help lift my mood a bit. I have also allowed myself more calories. I am joining a group of people on the 21 day fix, and we will be starting next week. My calorie bracket will be 2300. I will see how that goes. I think it will help minimize the binges. I have noticed when I try to stick close to 1800 calories I binge, which becomes a vicious cycle.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,I didn't have any apprehension about going because the people there are similar to me and are very supportive.

,,,,Am I supposed to do the techniques part every day? I have done part of it and then it was not there is there a saved copy?,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna, thanks for writing. Sorry I haven't connected with you yet. I like the idea of sticking to general principles about eating. For example, I know I do better when I eat regularly throughout the day and always have options available in my fridge/pantry that are healthy and things I can easily eat in a healthy amount. I don't think I'm really able/willing to plan every meal right now - except for things like breakfast where I always just have the same thing for breakfast - but my other meals I try to make from a set of ingredients that I keep on hand so I have good options - not in a restrictive way but in a way where the foods I'm eating don't make me more likely to lose control over eating. I actually don't like using food trackers that involve calories, etc., because not only are all calories not created equal, but I find that that sort of tracking feels restrictive to me and that makes me more likely to get out of control after a certain amount of time restricting. I think for me being mindful about how I'm feeling in general and related to eating is the most important thing I can do for myself.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

No - I have never had any issues with self-harm or suicidial ideations. It's just an intrusive thought.

,,,,"Hey Anna, sorry I haven't been able to participate in the modules as often as I was. I'm finishing medical school and doing a lot of traveling so my schedule is kind of all over the place right now. I am already involved with my school's counseling services and participate in individual therapy weekly. That therapy is my main focus of improving my mental health, and a lot of what we talk about there, naturally, carries over to what these modules talk about. I really want to continue using the modules, and it is actually very easy to do now that I can access them on my phone. I'm not the best at finding time to write to you, but please know I do take time to reflect on what I am learning in other ways.

When i'm in front of mirrors, I usually find something that I don't like and think how disgusting I look or how fat I am.

I guess I can try to think of positive things instead or try not to think so black and white. Marcia.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey Kristen, sorry for not getting back to you earlier, I was out of town for my mom's birthday and internet connection was difficult to get. As for the tracking, I find that tracking my meals just makes me more mindful of how often I am eating and helps me to remember more than if I didn't track. Things are going well though, I am driving back from Florida into New Orleans tomorrow morning and my spring break is coming to a close. I will be able to get back on track with working on sessions regularly then,
Marcia.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

Thank you it was nice! I was able to eat ice cream and potato chips with my family and at first I was nervous but found I enjoyed them. My stomach did get a little upset though just because I don't think i'm used to eating junk food.
Marcia.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Kristen, well this weekend I didn't really eat as much as I should have but i've also been sleeping a lot lately so it's been hard for me to eat on a regular schedule. I was never really a person who ate breakfast so I find it difficult to get in the habit of eating that early. 
Marcia",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Yeah i'm also in the last few weeks of school so the weekends i'm not really that active so I feel like the amount i've been eating has been able to sustain me.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,yeah I definitely notice i'm more likely to just not want to eat when i'm really stressed or lose my appetite all together. I have been trying to take care of myself by going out and seeing friends or taking a break once I finish an assignment to help make me feel less stressed.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hey my weekend went alright. I managed to get out of the house for a while and see live music with an old co-worker after finishing up all my work. I haven't been consciously aware of my body recently so I haven't been checking or avoiding but it has definitely been an issue for me in the past that I still struggle with. Mostly i'll avoid looking in mirrors or looking at pictures of myself because when I look at myself I hyper focus on a part of my body and it makes me upset.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Kristen,
it's really difficult to think of the thoughts at firs since they happen so quickly but it's interesting to see how I assume the worst in certain situations or jump to conclusions when I pay attention to my thoughts.
Marcia.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yeah now i'm just working on finishing up my papers before I can graduate! It's going alright, it's been a little bit harder to try and go on walks lately due to the change of schedule and preparing for finals but i'm going to try to set time out of the way to go walking.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I actually really liked the meditations, they were relaxing and helped put me in a better state after doing them. If they decide they like me there is a second interview i'd have to do with the team and I should know about it by the end of this week. Hopefully things work out,
Marcia.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks, my interview went well I believe. I have been going on more walks and walking my parents dogs but that's about the only exercise i've been getting. As for food, i've been eating very healthy and trying to be mindful of what I eat and eating when i'm hungry. 
Marcia",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Kristen, I have not heard back about the next stages yet but I am remaining hopeful as i'm being considered for more than one position at the same organization. 
As for body image and eating I would like to be more active and exercise as I have been neglecting that but I am supposed to go to the gym with a friend tomorrow. 
With the sessions I put that as my family in particular has been making comments that minimizes my experience and feelings as me overreacting or I shouldn't feel a certain way because others have it worse. It is frustrating and I know they mean well but I find it difficult to confront them. Apologies for the lengthy response,
Marcia.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks Kristen, I haven't brought it up yet but I think the next time they make comments I can talk about it in a sensitive manner. I haven't been having much of a development with a job but I am trying to apply to at least one job a day in the mean time.

Marcia.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Kristen, Yeah I find the hardest thing for me in general is confrontation and standing up for myself.

,,,,"Hey Kristen,
Yeah some of the interpersonal skills i'm learning I feel like are helping me to at least bring up the subject in a way that is effective and having to remember from earlier back types of thinking like back and white that makes me feel like people aren't going to like me anymore if I confront them is a cognitive distortion. Yes I am very ready to be employed already and thanks for your support,
Marcia",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Kristen,
Thanks they went alright and i'm actually starting to get more interviews now. I think I just like to avoid conflict and want other people to like me so I feel uncomfortable bringing something up if it might change how people view me.

Yeah it's definitely been a little stressful for me but some days are better than others. As for the eating, it's been good i've been eating really healthy and eating multiple times a day.

,,,,"Hey Kristen,
thank you for notifying me and for your support throughout this experience. As far as red flags go I would say the biggest red flag for me would be periods where I am under a lot of stress and feel out of control in my life. I have a tendency to spread myself very thin which has caused me to get burnt out in the past so I will have to be mindful of that. Another red flag will be if I start to become overly critical of myself or if I experience rejection from others. I will look through some of the previous techniques!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,my number one goals is to stop binge eating and purging!,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,I think this would help me a lot. I don't think i am at a stage where I can listen to my body's hunger cues so planning would be really nice. I am feeling really discouraged right now because I just had a binge. I ate lunch with a friend like the tips suggested but I was restricting again because the guy i was eating with ate less than i did and was talking about his own weightless journey. I left the dining hall feeling unsatisfied and uncomfortable. I came back to my room and all i had around were fig newtons and granola so I enjoyed myself.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My mom used to be judgmental of my eating habits. I felt like i couldn't tell her anything after i realized she was.

I have one friend who is a trained peer counselor for eating disorders who i trust. she is great at checking in and talking me through hard times. 
someone who is not going through the same situation is my older sister. she lost a lot of weight recently but never had a an eating disorder",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

This week, I've been feeling good so far. i realized i had these ""food police"" thoughts in my head that would try to get me to skip a meal or snack whenever I could. when i could, id think ""oh i can do this everyday"" but this behavior is what led me to binge eat.

I'm currently meeting with an eating disorders specialist at harvard and we have been talking about how to explain my recovery to my parents. they do not understand that i could have gone through an eating disorder and do not know about the behaviors i had. I can tell because every time i call them, they talk about my body, pose new weight goals for me, and try to change my diet.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Emma! thanks for checking in. I just spent a week at home in Dallas and ill be flying back to boston tomorrow. I noticed a change in lifestyle pace when i got home. Usually, me exercise regimen is much more intense when i am home because the group classes I go to are harder. My body is usually much more tired and i am much more vulnerable to binges. I think Ive binged twice daily for the last three days... i also tried to talk to my mom about my behaviors and it didn't go so well. she said i needed to have more will power. I have also been feeling extremely anxious when I eat around her which makes me lose intuition of my fullness...

I think going back to boston will help me get back on track for sure. I am feeling pretty insecure and out of control right now.... I'm talking to my university counselor about it.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Emma, I connected with my therapist via email, but I do not think I will be able to see her in person this summer. I think my schedule makes it easy for me to remain tired throughout the day. My diet does not change very often either... I am wondering if my constant exhaustion could be from a lack of a variety of nutrients? I recently started reading Brain over Binge and I have really enjoyed it. I think the story is all too similar to mine. She started dieting and restricting because her parents were warning her sister about the freshman 15 and because of her perfectionist tendencies, she took the dieting way too far which caused her brain to turn on animal instincts. I'd love to make a SMART plan with you. Would you have time to speak on the phone something on Friday or next week? I am in eastern time and would be happy to do any time of the day.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Emma, thanks for continually checking in with me. I'm sorry it took me so long to respond to your last message- I was finishing up my summer research. Your description of my reluctance to reach out to others us accurate. I honestly, have only found one person that I can share my story with. This is my gay best friend, Rodrigo. His sister went through the same thing, so he understands that girls really do go through this. 

There are a few things I want to work on overall, but I'm not sure which goals are suitable to work on with HBI.
1) I've noticed that I struggle with binging much more when I am alone. I think I've conviced myself that I have so little control of myself that I need to rely on others to make sure I eat at normal times and eat balanced meals.
2) I'd love to work on finding more support in my life. I'd love to find people who I feel comfortable sharing my circumstance with.

I'll be traveling until Wed. August 10th, but would love to schedule a call for after.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Emma,
Thanks for all your messages, and I apologize that I'm only seeing them now... I've been having some trouble logging into the app, but its all fixed now.
Anyways, this goal is something I've struggled a lot with in the past. When I was in treatment, and especially in residential, it was very difficult to complete the meal plan of three meals and two snacks for me. Outside of residential, even if I had agreed to do the meals/snacks according to my meal plan outside of program, more than often I did not. Eating so often makes me feel like it's too much, and that it will trigger a loss of control, or something. But, it's becoming clear to me that this is actually, really, what would be best for my body, my metabolism, and reduction of eating disordered thoughts and behaviors. 

I think it would be helpful for me to rate my hunger and fullness before and after each meal, as well as any thoughts leading into the meal, or that occurred after. Do you think that would be good? 

I can also use the meal planner to plan out the next couple of days.

,,,,Hey! I was doing real good and now that school has started again I feel like I am binging sometimes so I am excited to do the program again!,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Yeah I am trying to analyze what I can change to not have it happen. I would say I tend to binge more with desserts after dinner. I have some and it tastes wonderful so I just want more. Eating snacks and meals definitely helps me have smaller portions and prevented binging. I also noticed that if food isn't very flavorful or good I tend to eat more trying to reach that happy satisfied feeling.,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,I eat desserts after dinner every night. And I start out with moderation in mind.... But then go back for seconds thirds or maybe fourths,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

Also, I wouldn't rate myself as a 1 or 2 because I know that, while i' m not fond of my body image, I know that there are others who have it worse as they could have other health issues. I'm thankful that I at least don't have any serious health effects of being overweight.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Emma - thank you for speaking with me! Spring break just ended and it was lovely. I'm back at school so I just got back from the grocery store and bought a lot of fruits and healthy snacks! :) In the past when I've felt in control of my eating, it helped to cut down on carbs. It's so much easier for me to actually feel when I'm hungry/full when I'm eating non-carby foods (I think it's because carbs don't make me feel full/I just love them too much to stop eating when I'm full.) I'm going to try that again. I'm going to be planning my meals!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Although sometimes, I'm just not hungry (like for today, I only planned breakfast, a snack, and dinner because I woke up at noon.) Do you think that's okay, or should I still plan out three full meals and two snacks?",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"(Sorry for the super long messages - I just have one more question that I forgot to mention. I've been finding the tracking thing actually kind of not helpful, because it's so much like how I used to get obsessed with calorie counting, and I find myself getting anxious about sticking to the exact food items/times that I plan out. I'd much prefer to eat normally and when I'm hungry, even if it is/isn't on the planned list for that day. Do you think that would work?) Thank you so much! :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Okay, so today was a kind of horrible day. I ate really healthy and mindfully and flexibly until around 6 PM...and then I broke into the rest of the candy I'd bought today...which made me want to binge and so I did and now I'm eating more and more terrible food (mac and cheese and chips) and I feel physically very gross. Surprisingly, my body image no longer really suffers as much when I binge, because I still am confident and happy with myself as a whole mostly, but I really need to stop this ""binging to the point of wanting to vomit."" I've identified the point where I am most likely to be successful in breaking the chain: that moment after eating junk food, where I feel like I've already messed up so I might as well continue to mess up - I just don't know how to really stop myself from thinking like that, and really feeling that so much. Do you have any advice?",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It was pretty helpful! I really liked how the exercise helped me understand how to work with the binging habit I have (I actually think both the binging and the negative self-talk result from me just being too harsh on myself, and automatically thinking of everything in black and white when it comes to how healthy I've been or not.) It's still hard to change my thinking because that's just how I view most things in my life, but yesterday night, actually, it worked for me. I was getting ready to take a shower after having dinner with some friends (a completely unhealthy dinner with dessert and mac and cheese, which normally would have made me binge as soon as i got home) and i saw myself in the mirror, and really didn't like myself. But then I remembered this exercise and I started saying positive things out loud to counter the mean comments in my head, and I felt much better! :D I'm very proud of myself for actually trying the steps instead of just wallowing like I wanted to. This program is working already. :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Emma: yes, when I track, I feel like I'm ""reporting"" exactly what I ate at the end of the day, and the stress of trying to write down/remember every single thing I eat reminds me a lot of calorie counting. I end up either not eating enough, or eating way too much out of frustration with having to log everything. But I agree, I think it would be helpful for me to track my feelings and situations somehow. Maybe I could use the tracking tool less as a food log, and more as an emotional log? So instead of writing what I had for breakfast exactly, I could log how I felt after each meal in the description box? Would that work? I don't want to undermine the program because I know the tracking tool is made for a specific purpose, but I think that could work well. And thank you for your advice on the binging!! I've honestly never thought of distracting myself/moving to a different location when I'm on the brink of binging. I have noticed that all of my binges happen in my dorm room, when I'm alone, but I've always thought that to overcome binging, I just needed to concentrate really hard (I know how stupid that sounds!) :) I love that advice you gave me - thank you so much! My binges happen almost always at night in my dorm, but I could go to a study room in the basement or up to my friend's suite? Being with someone would prevent me from stuffing my face by myself.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"And regarding the self-esteem activity, I also would love to ask for your advice on this. I know it's one of my biggest triggers, and sources of anxiety - I know it's wrong to think like this, but I think I'll be happier and more attractive and that I'll have the life I want if I am skinnier. I like myself a lot now, but I am always picturing how much better everything will be once I lose weight. I don't know how to not feel that way.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Emma! Okay, I'll start with the tracking. I'm trying to keep to regular meals and snacks, because I tend to overeat when I'm just randomly eating through the day. YES, I haven't been binging! It's because I'm eating on a ""keto"" plan, which is a high fat, low carb diet. I did this when I was training for martial arts, and found it very effective afterwards for staving off hunger, helping tremendously with weight loss, and preventing binging since I don't ever want to binge on non-sweet things. (I don't remember if I wrote about this in a body check-in so apologies if this is repetitive!) It's working well so far, but I'm honestly scared about what I'm going to do after I stop eating keto, which I know isn't a healthy mindset to have. I want to establish normal, healthy, sustainable eating habits now, but I also know that I binge because I am frustrated with not losing weight, and keto helps me to break through that obstacle. What do you think?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Thank you! And I apologize for not updating my food tracking as often as I should - I tend to forget at the end of the day. But I'll do it now! :),,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"The keto diet works for me because it eliminates the carbs, which are my biggest weakness and trigger. I adhere pretty strictly, since I find it's easiest to go all out, but actually, I've decided that once a week, I'm going to have a carb treat. Yesterday I had a doughnut without any guilt or binging afterwards - and I actually only ate half because I didn't really want the rest! I'm really proud of that. :) My physician said that eating lower carb is fine, plus I'm just doing it for a few months! But you are absolutely right - I think I might actually talk to the on-campus nutritionist about it and see what she thinks.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"If I switched to a ""regular"" diet, I would be focusing on more healthy, whole grain foods (quinoa, beans, lots of produce, the occasional treat), and not carb amounts (I actually did this for a while, and made good choices, but I still wanted to lose weight and with the temptations of carbs, I actually ended up gaining weight!) Eventually, I definitely want to ""eat normally"" when I reach my happy weight, but right now I just don't trust myself to not binge and to lose weight if I let myself have carbs. I know that's not the most healthy mindset, but I find keto pretty easy to stick to and it gives me peace of mind because I don't have to portion out carbs/track everything the way I do when I don't eat keto.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hm...I think that avoiding those higher carb foods have given me a much greater sense of control and relaxation when it comes to my body - I don't feel that guilt and fear and worry about weight loss that I have when I eat them. But I also know that they have power over me because I'm avoiding them completely (save for one meal a week) and that's not ideal. I did, however, try having them last week (doughnut) and it went really well! Because it was planned, I didn't binge or even feel bad. I do think that it's better when I go to a restaurant/get a set portion - for example, this Friday, I'm going to a birthday party and plan to have cake and pasta there, but since it won't be an entire cake all to myself, I think it'll be okay. I'll keep you updated! :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"(Just realized that my food tracking for today was actually for yesterday - I messed up the dates!) But I wanted to let you know that today, I had some fear foods (a scheduled ""cheat meal"" of sorts) and it went really well! I just finished my cake and I don't feel the need to binge at all. I'm so happy! :)",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey Emma, I've been thinking a lot about why exactly my urges come on. I've noticed that that urge to binge and urge to just eat whatever I can get my hands on comes almost always at night, around 8-9 PM, and when I'm alone and in my room. Often, it's because I have tons of work and I use binging as a way to procrastinate/lessen my stress. Could you please give me some advice and tips on how to combat that? I think it's really interesting that I've identified that pattern, but since it happens so late at night on school nights, I am rarely able to go hang out with friends/physically remove myself from the situation. What do you think?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey Emma! In the past when I've tried to transition from keto to a more balanced, carb-inclusive diet, I end up just binging nonstop for weeks because I take my break from keto as a free-for-all. It's not good! I'm having a lot of success on keto, but ultimately I do want to meet with a nutritionist and find a sustainable plan. I do plan snacks for when I know I get hungry, but when that urge to binge strikes, it's so powerful and no amount of planning really helps me in the moment.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Emma! I just wanted to let you know that this morning, I met with a nutritionist and we talked about my keto diet and binging and how to eat sustainably. She gave me some really good advice - we've decided that I should stop eating keto, since it's not doing good things for my kidney or my health in general, but instead, I'll be gradually incorporating more healthy carbs. :)",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My reflections on my learning and progress: prior to this program, I knew several of the techniques that were taught, but the program did introduce some methods to prevent binge-eating that were new and helpful to me. However, I've never found cognitive logic to be the problem. For me, it's always been the biological component of the binge itself (the physical urge, the blood pressure, etc.) My challenge, particularly after meeting with my nutritionist, has been battling those physical cravings, but just as importantly, trying to refigure my goals with my body. Losing weight for me would be healthy, if I do it in the correct way, but I need to frame it as a personally-uplifting and improving thing, and not as a bid for the approval of others.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

I'm also a little worried that tracking what I eat isn't going to help me, it'll just make me think about food even more. I'm actually at home right now and this was the best week I've had body image wise in a long time, mostly because I wasn't constantly thinking about food and counting calories and planning meals.

She took the survey when the email was initially sent out, but was too scared to actually submit the results. She said that she, like me, was worried about the time commitment. I told her that I've been finding plenty of time and see the program helping me view myself in a much brighter light. Is there any way she could start the program? Or is it too late?

Also, I really liked this past section about body image as I feel that is what I struggle with the most.

Thanks for all of your support throughout the program, I appreciate it!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Right now I'm managing 17 credits, two shifts/week at the restaurant where I work, I co-facilitate a support group once a month, and when I'm not working I try to exercise and hang out with friends/boyfriend/family. Restrictive eating has always been a part of my life. I grew up in a home where health and eating habits were overemphasized. My siblings and I have mesomorphic body types?great athletes but not skinny. Everyone in my family has a very messed up relationship with food. Not to bore you with my life history, but just to put this all in context. Restriction has always been a result of wanting to feel ?in control? (surprise surprise). I am still learning to trust myself with food, because I?m prone to stress binging, so restriction (not bringing foods into the house that I might binge on, to prevent myself from binging) does generally lead to binging ultimately (because I finally give into cravings and stop at the grocery store or something). I read two books about intuitive eating (Intuitive Eating, and How to Have Your Cake and Your Skinny Jeans Too) over the winter, and they were awesome (I highly recommend you read them/suggest them to others). I have been trying to be more in tune with hunger and satiety signals and trying to lose the ?good food vs. bad food? mentality, but it?s a constant challenge. Binging also almost inevitably occurs when I drink alcohol, which I have been trying very hard to limit?but again, restriction leads to the periodic alcohol binge, not unlike food. Certainly I would like to/have been trying to change these patterns. I am curious, why did you choose to get involved in this program? Are you studying/licensed in a health field?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I was hoping that by starting this program I would hold myself more accountable for managing my stress in healthier ways (and to a certain extent I have), but old habits die hard. I do know that this transition is not going to happen overnight, but I've been struggling with an eating disorder for years now. It's horrible and unhealthy, but I've never had to feel embarrassment (which is particularly relevant as someone who is pursuing a career in a health field) because I've never told anyone about it. Until now. And if I don't get anything more out of this program than merely knowing that I have finally owned up to my issues (albeit to a virtual coach....), then I still consider it a step in the right direction.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you for checking in. It's been a rough two weeks. I haven't been exercising. Feel like crap. Prioritizing school at the expense of my health right now, without much of a choice. I've got less than a month, and that's what's keeping me afloat. I feel pretty terrible about my body though, since I've 'let myself go' lately. Tired of cycling like this. I have been consciously trying not to use food as a distraction, but it happens. Usually late at night.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you! As I said before, I started this program knowing that the level of difficulty I would have in addressing my disordered eating was going to increase significantly over the course of the semester. And it did. I have appreciated this program as a reminder to try to continue to make healthy choices. I agree that I should seek additionally professional services, and although I don't think I will do it through my school, I have looked at options in the community. I hope that you don't think that my lack of improvement is any reflection of you as a coach. You have been wonderful, and I have sincerely appreciated all your support!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

I came home from my last final and had to put the cat down, so it hasn't been the easiest transition to freedom, but I am certainly taking advantage of this first week of break to catch up on life.

,,,,"I'm really trying to reduce the binge/purge episodes. Like really. trying. I've definitely gained some weight from refraining from restricting my eating as much as I used to in the past--because that usually initiates the whole cycle. I have had a lot of conflicting thoughts regarding my body, but I am really making an effort to try to maintain a healthier self image. I bought another self-help book that I have been reading. I recently found out that my dad has cancer (no pity party needed-life is just kind of a cruel joke this year...), so taking this opportunity to practice managing my stress in healthier ways.

,,,,"Thanks for checking in, Emma. Let me see if I can come up with a SMART goal for myself (if I can't, I shouldn't be graduating in December :) ). In this book I've been reading, the author discusses a strategy for reflecting on feelings of hunger in terms of 'coming from the stomach' vs. 'coming from the head' (i.e. actual hunger vs. emotional/coping/boredom hunger). So, over the next week, I'd like to consciously identify whether or not my hunger is 'coming from my stomach' 80% of the time I go to eat a meal/snack. I know that this isn't always black or white and I'm not going to shame myself if my hunger is 'coming from my head,' but I'm hoping this will help me to be more considerate of my actual hunger and satiety. Let me know if I need to reframe the goal. Hope you are well!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I have not learned many techniques yet but I like the ones that I have learned, I feel like they are insightful and I am getting a really good picture of myself and my habits, and what works or doesn't work for me.

Thanks for continually messaging me! I appreciate the support. I am interested in getting the iPhone application for this program, could you let me know how to do that? I tried just downloading the app for Lantern and it said my email was not registered in their system. Also, I would love to set up a date and time to speak with you over the phone. I am a full-time student and I also work part-time ~20 hours/week so I have very few times when I'm available, but I can give you a few of those times/days if you want, so you can choose what is best for you. I have only just begun the meal tracking, but I think it is already helping me be more aware of how much I eat & my eating habits in general. I hope it will continue to aid me and give me some insight about myself. Looking forward to hearing back from you,

,,,,"Hi Emily, I did find the Break the Chain exercise to be useful. It has made me more mindful of my bad habits, and though sometimes I forget, I often am able to remind myself not to fall into those habits. I still find myself thinking a lot about my body and wanting to see how I look in the mirror, but I try to avoid it and instead focus on how I physically feel, which makes me feel better about myself. I can talk with you on Saturday for 15 minutes, what time would be best for you? I am free all day. I want to set up a time so I know when to expect your call. I have bad cell service in my room, so if I know when you will call I can move to a place in my apartment with better reception. The meal tracking has definitely held me accountable and has helped me be a little better at not eating sweets at night, though sometimes I do slip up.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I think now, I will be able to notice when I start thinking in this way, and perhaps when I recognize it I will be able to stop it. You may have seen that recently, I have binged twice (in two days). I am under more stress than usual and I think that is why these episodes have happened. Do you know of any techniques to help cope with the negative feelings that happen after a binge episode? And any methods to help stop a binge episode from progressing once it has started?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hey Emily. Thankfully I finished finals last week. I appreciate that you let me know there will be future lessons covering how to deal with binge episodes. Your questions about my thoughts and feelings before and during binges has helped me become more aware of when I am susceptible to bingeing, and what types of thoughts commonly lead me to bingeing. I still am not sure what my specific triggers are, but I will continue working on figuring them out. I have been trying to have one sweet thing (cookie, piece of chocolate) a night along with some tea to help balance out the sweetness, and I think it has been working well--I have found that I am better able to control myself around sweets, and have even been able to stop behaviors that lead me to overeating (like offering to finish off a friend's plate even when I am already full, or having a large amount of sweets). Thank you for your advice!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

So far I really like the Managing Emotions tool. I had difficulty recognizing my emotions so I think this section on Emotion Regulation will be really helpful for me. I like what I have learned so far and I hope that it can make me more aware of my emotions & how to manage them.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Usually, with eating behaviors, I feel anxious and my thoughts become obsessive and focused on eating whatever it is that I am craving at the moment. I've noticed that if I tell someone about how I'm feeling, and they suggest that I should probably not act on my craving if I'm already full, I get unreasonably angry and irritated with them. I feel like that is because I have already made up my mind about what I want to do, and I become very close-minded and don't want to do anything else that someone suggests.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I don't know what kind of reaction I would want from people. I think that when I am in that kind of mood, I am just easily annoyed and would rather overeat than deal with my feelings. I have also noticed that whenever there are sweets in the house, I feel obliged to eat them so that they don't ""go to waste"" and get thrown out. I feel like I frequently treat my body as a trash can, eating things I might not even want to. I thought I did this just because I did not want to waste food (or the money I used to buy the food) but I think maybe this is just an excuse to overeat. Do you have any tips for overcoming the strong desire to have sweets even after I am full?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I will try varying my sweets schedule to help with feeling like I am forcing myself to have sweets when I really don't want them. Mindfulness can help but it is definitely hard to keep in mind when I am emotional or letting myself fall back into my bad habits. I really like the technique where you embrace the negative feelings that you are facing--I tend to try and run away from or ignore my feelings, which makes them pile up and get worse in the long run. I've found that embracing extreme emotions helps me to have more control over them, and makes me feel less panicked to try and get rid of them. I feel a lot more peaceful and okay with my feelings once I have let myself really notice and experience the feelings.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I try to have sweets every night but I think this has just made things worse, because I feel the obligation to eat something sweet every night, and it has led me to overeat more than I usually would. It has also worsened my cravings for sweet things. I think I need a different approach so that I am not always feeling like I need to eating something sweet.

,,,,"Hi Ellen! About the breakfast, I simply stopped eating any hazelnut speard for now, and am sticking to jam and honey. No binge at breakfast since then! I have also been sleeping a lot better (thanks to the sleep talk-down - what I love about it is the relaxation talk-down coupled with the sound of ocean waves!) and I have also been exercising a little bit, so right now I feel healthier, which is amazing. I am also thinking a lot less about food, so I feel like a whole part of my brain space has just become available again. The breathing technique works well too, but I don't yet have the automatism of doing it in the middle of my day when something stressful happens.. but at least noe I know there is always that option to handle a stressful situation, rather than binging.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

I was really tired so I slept in until noon and then I haven't been eating sweets recently but I was craving them so I ate three mini candy bars and an ice cream sandwich. The only real food I ate today was a turkey sandwich and even that is bad because of the bread. I also bought myself a pair of $100 shoes. I have pretty weird ways of making myself feel better...I have tried the exercising and meditating to make me feel better and sometimes it does but today all I wanted were sweets. I doubt that eating three mini candy bars and an ice cream sandwich constitutes binging but I did not feel in control over my eating today at all.

It's mostly just in my head and comparing myself to others that are skinny, but the thing is I never want to be skinny I want to be healthy and fit. I follow a lot of fitness athletes for motivation, but on bad days they make me sad and aren't motivating. Then when I am out I see a lot of people that eat like shit and are twigs. It gets frustrating, but I just need to focus on me and be proud of everything I have and my progress I have made.

,,,,The triggers are when I feel dissatisfied with my body shape or I've recently eaten too much. The thought of losing weight is constant when I am larger than a certain size. Stepping on a scale or putting on clothes that don't fit well are immediate triggers.,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I have been having these feelings since I started feeling fat at 16, but I didn't start restricting severely until I was 18. At 18 I went on a diet where I ate 600 calories per day for a month and lost about 25 lbs, and was at my lowest adult weight. But then I started binge eating heavily and gained almost 60 lbs over 1.5 years. Since then my eating has been very disordered, but it has gradually stabilized more over the past 5 years.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Sarah, I am having trouble right now because of my weight. I have been eating more than usual (regular meals that are satisfying and have lots of carbs) as per the instruction of the nutritionist who is part of the eating disorder team. I can feel myself getting fatter, and it's causing me to want to binge right now, since it seems there's no point in continuing to eat well. Can you recommend anything to prevent me from feeling so discouraged?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes, the nutritionist is asking me to eat a lot of carbs. She thinks that my binges are fueled by restriction of my meals. She believes my body's response to food will normalize if I eat more and regularly. She is recommending 3 good meals and 2 snacks with lots of carbs each day.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I like the 4-7-8 breathing technique, and I've been using it a lot to calm myself and get to a mindful state. I've also been trying out the break the chain technique, where I try doing something different from my usual urges.

This has felt good, but I still have to be very mindful in order to make it a habit.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I am feeling less bad about my body shape and less critical of the fact that I'm overweight. It's easier for me to accept my body type and believe that I can still feel good about myself. However, I'm still obsessed over the amounts of food I am eating and my body weight. I've started tracking my calories over the past 5 days, and I think it's making me obsess over food again. I'm finding that I need a lot more calories in a meal to feel satisfied - sometimes up to 600 calories. This has made me want to restrict my diet again.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I was traveling for 2 weeks and didn't have the chance to check in. I was carefully tracking my calories, and have been feeling stressed about the lack of change in my body. It's making me feel discouraged.

,,,,"Yes, it helped, and actually I haven't been thinking about or being bothered by my body that much lately.

I have a really bad habit of jumping into the ""my feelings are an overreaction"" mindset. This makes me try to ""suck it up"" sometimes in the middle of an argument, which just makes things worse. I'm very interested to see what coping strategies that I could use to turn this off for a bit! :)

I'm trying to make sure that I eat during my breaks at work, that I make sure to include snacks in my days off, and have been trying to get more protien! I started packing lunch, and a couple of snacks, which is helping a lot!

I think I actually want to pick up on my old hobbies, that I choose TV/eating over, like reading and going outside a little more. Hopefully, when work isn't so random, I'll get to start excersizing agian!
-Alyssa",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Jackie,
Thanks! I think keeping busy and getting in a routine has helped me a lot with binging. However, I think the ""routine"" has also made me a little less flexible in eating-- I get frustrated when I don't get to follow my plan. That's something to really work on!
-Alyssa",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

The self-care was an interesting thing! Right now, I think I do a lot of positive self-care practices, but I'd like to start working out to help with stress, and I'd like to stop shopping/eating to deal with feelings.

Thank you! I'm trying to learn how to deal with cravings. On a real positive, I haven't been doing an all day binge like I usually have. I think this is just me getting past the initial two weeks of eating more mindfully (like, past the honymoon phase).
-Alyssa",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Jackie,
Thanks for checking in. For me, I don't really ""avoid"" foods, but there are foods that I only buy if I intend to binge. Like, I worry if they're just there I will lose control. I worry that gives the food too much power, and makes it impossible to eat regularly in that situation. I think I really just need to focus on eating these public, when I plan to, and when I'm not sad/bored.
Thanks agian!

I actually feel like in the last few years, I've gotten out of constantly checking my weight, but now instead avoid it like nothing before. It is my goal to start weighing myself once a week, and the mirror activity was an interesting tool in progressing.

Thanks for the check in. Lucky for me, I've had a lot of help with automatic thoughts-- its the majority of the reason that I was in therapy originally. However, I really liked being able to categorize each thought into a style, It helps me reflect a little better!
Thanks, 
Alyssa",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Jackie,
Thanks for the encouragement! I think the routine has finally kicked in, so it's literally easier for me to just go on with eating healthy than binge eat! It is so much easier to listen to my body's cues, now that I'm actually use to eating better.
Thanks again, and enjoy your day!

Thank you! Yes, I have had set backs before. Maybe I didn't go to the gym on Tuesday like I'd planned. It tends to snowball for me into giving up. I know there will be set backs, but I'd like to keep going regardless. Hopefully, the techniques I've learned will help with that!
Have a nice day!

Sorry I didn't get a chance to write sooner! It was tax-free weekend here, so you can imagine I had a heavy work load. The three good things were interesting, but I do believe I'm pretty thankful for everyone in my life already. The meditation is interesting-- it seems very much like the initial mindfulness technique. The whole ""living in the moment"" concept. Once again, that is something I would like to work on!
Talk to you tomorrow!
Alyssa",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Jackie,
I generally worry that with my communication skills, I try to dull down the issue, until I blow up and just make the situation bigger than it needs to be. This especially happens with my boyfriend, as if you think about it, the relationship is based on if we like being together or not. I really am trying to be better at using these with him so he doesn't feel as if a concern I have is a personal attack on him.
Thanks!

I think I have completed the ""Introduction to Healthy Eating"" portion, the very first part, but it seems Lantern doesn't save answers and I've been slacking since I first signed up and filled these out on June 2. I just re-visited the first 2 questions and submitted new answers, though. 
Anyways, I do have time next Tuesday between 10 and 1 for a call. (My chemistry lecture that day starts at 2, so it's good!)",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

I've had a couple things on my mind, actually, which can be generalized into feeling hindered to ""live life"" by body image issues..? I'm seeing a lot of freshmen appear on campus, looking so ready to take on the college life, and I wonder if I could be more enthusiastic about my next stage in life if I wasn't so concerned about body image. 
I don't even know if body image is the origin of all my problems, but it always finds a way to sneak in when I'm trying to pinpoint what it is. Probably because it's linked so much to self-esteem. I'm rambling a lot now.. will save for the phone call :P",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I spent a day with my roommate in Sacramento today, now I'm back in Berkeley, and tomorrow afternoon my sister and I are going to visit my cousin.

,,,,"So that was good, but I don't really enjoy this part of the program. Don't particularly like being told to eat something I just don't want to :/",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"We are nearing the end of this semester now! I think I'll just lay out some of my thoughts: 
(1) I feel like I've made some serious progress in the last couple of months, though it wasn't exactly through the program (haha as you can see, I haven't stuck to it). I couldn't commit to lantern because it required me to think / make conscious efforts, and I didn't want to... haha maybe we can talk about this later. But instead I focused a lot on being active and having fun with wonderful dance club members, and that has done me good. 
(2) That being said, I definitely still have times when I feel held back from being active and having fun. I'm actually feeling it more and more these days, as finals are coming up (stress!) and I'm getting close to going home. 
(3) Going home poses a couple of exciting and dreadful scenes. The last time I flew back to Taiwan was a year ago, so I'm terribly happy to return this Christmas. On the other hand, I'm quite sure that my body has gotten even bigger, and people love to notice these things, so I'm actually quite scared of seeing people again. Another thing is I will go to see the doctor I trust the most with these hormonal issues I have. I never want to blame birth control pills for my weight but I can't help thinking that the hormones in my body play a huge role in this persistent weight gain. 

// hehe I tried not to write too much, but I definitely want to give you an idea of where I'm at, esp. since I've been so gone.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"(3) The one person in my family who I?ve shared some of my eating disordered thoughts with is my older sister, who will also be visiting home with me over Christmas. I?ve not wanted to tell my parents, but Mom knows I am very bothered by my weight since puberty hit. We both have been, because I have just kept gaining weight after tenth grade and (this is medical) my period never came naturally (still hasn?t). It?s a general concern that no doctors have a sure explanation for. And it?s kind of a bother~ just kind of~ So whenever I express frustration with my body to my Mom, it?s usually in the context of this",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Neha, haha yes outlines are the best! Let?s see~ (1) Some specific day-to-day instances that I find myself taking note of, because they actually surprise me with their indication of progress: - when I consider buying clothing for myself (and sometimes even buying?¦), whereas before any shopping was strictly just for friends because no clothes fit me right, right? :/ ; when I don?t have to scrutinize a menu eating out with friends (and overall eating out with friends more! Not good for the wallet though); when people around talk about how they?re ?fat? and need to ?exercise? and ?eat healthy,? which used to be such triggering/infuriating things to hear, and sometimes still is, but I?ve been taking them well I think; when I was actually excited about a fun themed photoshoot we had for our dance team, because I have been so scared to see myself in pictures for?¦ever. And yeah, I like to just ignore my problems for as much as I can, but they usually will just come back roaring at the worst times?¦yet it takes such a conscious effort to work for recovery?¦I guess progress really fluctuates up/down, and just gotta see that the general trendline is in fact positive.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Neha, yes I am proud of myself for making real effort to prioritize health and wellness this semester. But not enough to prepare me for boarding this plane and going back to see old friends and family..feeling quite anxious and unready right now :(",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi! I will get back from camp August 22nd. And as for planning meals, I usually do in my head the night before I go to sleep. I've tried writing it before and it's not only time consuming but also stresses me out when I have something written down and it changes, so I've found it more helpful just to track afterward to know there will be some sort of accountability",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"In response to your questions, I did like the break the chain activity -- I've done similar exercises in therapy previously but this one seemed more effective for some reason (guessing because I had to put something down to continue to the next question). Exercise has been closely related to my eating behaviors since I developed my eating disorder. I would exercise to lose weight and restrict/punish. Now, when I don't feel like I'm restricting, exercising makes me feel really great and gives me a sense of empowerment and control over my day. It's just hard to get myself to do it...and I won't do it if I binge before",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,Hi Anna sorry for the delayed response! I ended up hiking in the Appalachians all week and forgot about this.

,,,,I'm on my day off today and will complete a session! Things are going well!,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I would say talking to friends and family is self care because it allows me to process and release emotions by talking about them or distracts me (in a funny conversation for example) and releases stress that way. As for the food options, I wouldn't really say those are self-care...typically that's a way I deal with stress that leads to more stress (bingeing)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi, thanks for your responses. I appreciate the referral but am hoping to not need it by the time I get back to Stanford! To answer your question about rigidity leading to bingeing, it certainly can -- if I can't follow my plan I'm more likely to binge (very classic black/white thinking), but I've found that when I'm not following a plan and using more flexibility I constantly binge, so being rigid is really helpful at least for right now, though I know it's definitely not the ultimate goal.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey Anna, so sorry I'm only just catching up with everything! Camp actually went super well and I'm feeling positive about this transition and eating normally.

,,,,"Ehh I binged for the first time tonight. :/ I've labeled a couple others as ""binges"" but they really aren't. Tonight with the nuts though, I ate so many by myself and immediately felt like I should purge them. I didn't - but that doesn't help overcome the feeling that I should. I know we have a call tomorrow but just wanted to write this down when I still feel like confessing and to prevent myself from doing something more drastic to get rid of this guilty feeling.

,,,,"Hi Sarah, apologies! I thought you would be calling me but now realize I misread the message. Will call you now!",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes, I tend to restrict what I eat more because I'm constantly comparing what I eat to what she eats. Then sometimes I just give up entirely and end up binging to make up for the restricting beforehand",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hmm, also, it's worse when my middle sister (similar in height but different body type, more ""feminine"") comes home. I become hyper aware of how she looks and what she eats, and feel like I have to eat less than her or try to get her to eat more. Not sure what to do about that - but being around her stresses me out than I'd like to admit",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Being at home, where there is less happening on an urgent basis, makes food the primary way to break up my day and readily available. On vacation, I either had too many other things to do or was hungry but didn't have anything to snack on so I'd just wait until a more convenient time. Sometimes, that meant the hunger would go away until I was able to find food again.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

,,,,"I'm glad we had a chance to chat too. I do wish I felt more comfortable opening up to friends and family, but I find them usually less than useful. My mom and my best friend (male) usually don't understand or say something that makes me feel worse. And I'm afraid that if I talk too much about it with my sisters, they'll start to over analyze what I do, or worse, pick up eating disorder behaviors themselves. What do you think?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Also I gradually feel my appetite increasing compared to when I was on vacation and that worries me. I lost weight while traveling (about 5 lbs) and liked where my body was then though was terrified of gaining that weight back. Now, though I haven't weighed myself yet, I feel like I'm picking it back up as my appetite returns to normal, non-travel amounts.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It shouldn't be as much of a problem now as we are headed separate ways for a bit. I think it's more in my head than not. When we are at home together though, it'd be strange if I didn't eat with the family",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Question about the tracking - do I have to keep up with it? Will there be a review of it afterwards? Or is the tracking in and of itself supposed to help? I'm finding it a bit time consuming, particularly when I'm about to go travel",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Not really, mainly because I naturally have so many other things to think about that are non food related",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"The meditation ones are nice, but usually only temporarily. I feel like they put a halt to what I'm thinking about at the moment, but then those thoughts come back pretty quickly",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Neha, 
I don't remember what happened to bring on the binge from a couple or few days ago...and it probably wasn't even a full-on binge. Yesterday, however, was. Yesterday I was in a foul mood. I have been generally bummed on life the last couple/few days. Yesterday was a (pardon my language) ""fuck it"" day. I accomplished very little. I was disappointed in an internet date I went on. I hadn't eaten anything but a Kind bar...and then all hell broke loose. I had a gift certificate to this Sri Lankan place (probably meant to be shared), but I used the whole thing on myself (as a to-go order). Then, with real food in tow, I went to a yogurt place and had a very conservative amount of froyo...which, after eating, decided it wasn't enough. So I went to another one closer to my place. While on the drive there I was eating the curry with my hands and debating whether or not I should just go home. I convinced myself traffic was too annoying and I could use the froyo spoon (I through the other one away) for my real food. In the end I stopped by the second froyo shop, purchased an obscene amount of froyo...killed it...and then ate most of the rest of my Sri Lankan food. To make myself feel better I didn't eat much of the rice, just everything else. 

So what instigated it?
A bad attitude on my part, waiting too long to eat something, and feeling pissed off that I wasted the day on a date that wasn't bad, it just wasn't what I wanted (his brain was great...but that's about it, if you feel me). On top of all of that, I'm stressed out about what the hell I'm doing with my life (I know that's a trigger for me taking in way too much information and putting a lot of unnecessary pressure on myself/mental state)...but here me out: I've been working and in school for many years. I'm over my mind-numbing job, but not over the benefits (how much can I tell you?). I've been single for a very long time. I'm in a ""is this transitional?"" time in my life...Not to mention my lack of community anywhere, at this point. Home is not home, but neither is any other place I've lived. I feel completely detached from anything and everything. 

How long can these messages be? haha
OH!
Another big thing is that I haven't had time to do any real exercise (which is only partially true, but it feels true to me now). I am hating how much I am out of my healthy routine (which lord knows when I was really in one...8 years ago?...sucks).

On that note, I did had a good day at work this morning. It was busy and not so routine. The time went by fast and the people were pleasant.

I haven't eaten much yet either. Somehow everything still seems good. I'm in no way about to binge.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Neha!

It's now my turn to apologize for my delayed message!
I was in Philly as a Bernie advocate/protestor (inside and outside the convention). So this week has been...a roller coaster, but in a really good way. I was telling other Bernie delegates and protestors that things felt bipolar: everyday was so amazing, in the sense that I was surrounded by amazing people and we were actively doing (what I felt) was necessary. Then there were moments where I felt middle-school-rage with ignorant and angry Hillary supporters. In saying that, I just want to address that I also met really amazing Hillary supporters as well.

As for food in Philly...I mainly ate a huge (mostly) healthy breakfast (compliments to the CA Dems), and then nothing until 8-10pm. So...big gaps, for sure.
I had one unhealthy dinner, and it was a bit of a binge, but I didn't feel bad about it at all. Too hungry to care and I was with a really good friend - which we bonded even more out in philly.

As for what you wrote, I liked most of it. Google Docs, definitely should get on that...
Tomorrow is my one day off and I really want to work on myself. 
I feel super motivated to better my standards on health, stay active in politics, and start the organization re-vamp.
...5 meals or snacks in between...that one is going to be super rough.
Just really have no idea how I can pull that one off...",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"As a start, how many meals/snacks do you usually eat in a day?

I just want to make sure I'm actually answering your questions, so I'm copying/pasting here.
There is no usual...but my average is two meals...or two moments when I'm actually hungry or convinced myself I'm hungry.
Anything more than two and I feel like I'm forcing myself to eat. And I'm usually wanting a third before I go to bed - which I know that's my body telling me to eat if I stay awake, so I hate eating before I go to bed. 
So, yes, the average is two moments when I eat. 

...you rated your interest in the Healthy Body Image Program at a 2. That?s totally fine, but I just wanted to ask you if there?s something some topic or activity that would make things more interesting for you? More importantly, what do you hope to get out of this program?

I hope to gain some insight to enlighten my thinking. I notice when I feel good about food: when I'm physically active and with lovely people. That combination is rare. So how do I not hate myself, hate making food, hate eating food, and hate my body for wanting food for most of my existence? If I could have any quick fix in the world, it would be for someone else to make food my way (haha - I'm pretty sure that's what everyone wants when they don't have time or resources). I just eat to stop thinking about eating. I'm not anorexic in the sense that I obsess about food. I find food to be bothersome. I wish I was never hungry. I mean, I wish I was thinner as well, but convenience seems to trump content when I'm not at home and don't have time/resources to make what I want (which is most of the time). 
Maybe I'm 100% just making excuses for myself.
Not maybe. I'm sure I am...at least 80% of the time.
So I guess I just need a push to set my priorities straight instead of a lot of excuses, and reflecting on all of my ""slipping.""

Does that make sense?",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I really wanted my coworker to be my diet/exercise buddy ? so we could support each other and motivate each other to stay on track. She wasn?t down for it. The only person I know who cares about their health is someone who co-owns a donut shop and probably has more body image issues than I do?¦she?s also not someone I particularly get along with. Therefore I have no buddy system at work?¦plus everyone eats meat, makes and brings in heavy desserts, and appears to have a mostly sedentary lifestyle. The general trend is away from health. The ?taking advantage of? part comes from feeling like my goals are a joke because I look like the crazy health nut (when I?m clearly not ? you see what I eat) in comparison to coworkers. As far as outside of work, I think I?m slowly reducing the randoms in my life, therefore will hopefully have a core crew of people to call my friends. Hopefully that will reduce the amount of ?flexibility? I feel forced to have because going out one or two nights a week for the random people I hang out with equals their one or two times of flexibility, whereas I have been meeting up with people 4 or 5 times in the week and expected to be flexible every time. I am over that (I say that, but then I seem to get myself back into that all too frequently).
My ideas on losing weight, eating better, and working out more are definitely things I don?t trust sharing with people. I did recently ?come out? to a guy who is a bit obsessed with the gym (and I?m probably perpetuating the stigma of people who frequent the gym by saying he?s obsessed). I asked if I could be his gym buddy and he seems happy to take me under his far too muscular wing. Haha 
I went to Alaska this weekend, so this weekend was a big wash. Today is my birthday, and I have no plans, don?t have to work, and will being going to the gym shortly.

,,,,"I?m so pissed off today. I tried to fly to Salt Lake to meet my parents and aunt and uncle to go to my aunt?s cabin with them for the weekend (which was an idea I pushed for back in June). For multiple reasons, I missed my flight. I called to let my coworkers know I was running late, but I would still make it before the 10 minute closing of the door time. A woman at TSA had to flag my bag because I brought an audio book that apparently looked like a pocketknife. I can?t tell you how much I despise TSA. So many reasons, and today just added to the list. This all happened at 12:50pm. It?s 5:10pm and I?m only slightly less angry. To add insult to injury, when I called my dad to let him know I missed my flight, he informed me everyone was already at the cabin. Apparently my comment about potentially renting a car because I didn?t have Monday off from work and everyone was staying until Monday meant that I was definitely renting a car. I could not have felt more pushed out of the event I planned. Then (yeah, there?s more) my mom texts me about her friend?s lost iPad on a Delta flight. Are you kidding me mom?! I don?t give a F^<{ about your friend not inputting the correct email address to be contracted in regards to retrieving an item she has now been twice negligent in keeping. 
I had the last of the trail mix for breakfast at 10am. Nothing else. Not hungry. Could definitely throw back some whiskey and a throw the empty bottle at TSA. Haha. That thought actually brought me back a little from the crazy-angry ledge.

I quit the online dating thing just now as well (I was going to yesterday, but I dilly dallied). Still gave my number out to a few people to see if that lights a fire to meet. The effort of meeting people off the internet seems so ridiculous. The ratio of time to success in which you meet someone and actually like them have such terrible odds, I?m shocked internet/app dating use is rising. It just makes me think if people are so willing to fail in finding an SO, why there?s such a decrease in entrepreneurial endeavors.

Binges?¦I may not be binging 3,000 calories and then sitting on the toilet for 2 hours, but the feeling of loss of control is spot on?¦but not, actually. I feel like binges are also a form of control. I can?t go off on other people, I can?t fight for real autonomy at work anymore (because I have tried and failed multiple times over), I?m constantly being monitored, I?m surrounded by people who are anything but mentally stimulating (not all, but most)?¦I?m unsure of fall classes that are starting soon?¦ so many things I can?t control.

,,,,"1) In your own words, what?s your definition of a ?healthy? lifestyle?
If I were to look at a pie chart entitled ?Healthy Lifestyle? it would be broken down like this: 10% flexibility with unhealthy food, laziness, vegging out. 10% spontaneity ? unplanned food, unplanned dates, hang sessions, trips, etc. 80% actively pursuing health: exercise, reading, fruit, veg, whole grains. There?s balance, but it?s actively tipped towards a consciously healthy mind and body. And when I look at that applied to me, my pie chart looks very very different. It?s a bummer.

2) Do you have some other hobbies or interests that are unrelated to eating or exercising that you consider to be important to you?
Being politically active, learning about climate change, corruption, corporate greed, and I could keep going. Ha!

,,,,"What restricting on my birthday entailed:
I didn?t eat much on my birthday except trail mix. Eventually a couple of girl friends came over and we split a bottle of wine between the three of us. 

What does control mean to me:
Funny that you ask me this. My immediate thought was, not having to practice self-control at all. Which sounds oddly parallel to religious talk. If women wear burkas and black gowns to hide their hair-to-toes, then dudes don?t have to practice self-control at all. I have a new found sympathy for their reasonings. So, sex sells as well as convenience, confections, and comfort foods. Therefore, what I am to do about it? Put black cloth on top of all food at work. That?s actually not a half-bad idea. 
Okay back to defining control. Sorry about the rant above?¦it may or may not be of any use to you. Control means being able to fully comprehend all of my actions before acting on them. For instance, Twizzlers: they have no nutritional value, they have no substantial filling-of-the-stomach value, they seriously don?t even taste that good. However, they?re always around. They?re easy to consume. They require no fork to clean, and no reason for a mirror to check for grime in the grill. Easy, chewy, waxy gnawing material?¦Have you seen the ingredients in Twizzlers? Terrible. Corn syrup, flour, sugar, and then 2% or less of weird shit you glaze over and truly don?t want to know about because you already hate yourself by the first 3 ingredients. 
Most of the time, I?m cool with Twizzlers in my face. However, when I can?t go off on passengers, and I can?t go off on coworkers that try to takeover my flight, my paperwork, my issue with a passenger, I can?t hold it. I get snarky and sarcastic and then I grab a Twizzler almost to prove I could turn it into some inadequate weapon if I really wanted to.
But there are so many other snacks. Luckily work hasn?t switched up the snacks. I?ve almost eaten myself sick of their typical snacks.
Back to defining control (clearly I have a hard time controlling my answer to this question, giving you oh-so-much insight)?¦
Control is saying ?no? especially when you want to ?yes.?
That shit is hard.

What situation makes me feel in control and what situation makes me feel out of control?
I feel like I answered this above. I feel in control when my environment is controlled for. When I don?t have to think about controlling myself, then I can act freely in it. When my environment is out of control I suddenly have to restrict myself in it. Hence the burka comparison.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

Yesterday was also the 3rd day of being on my period. I knew the day I started (well before I started) I felt like I needed to cry about something. I was so busy that I didn?t cry.

But I don't even want to do anything to accomplish anything. I am my own worst enemy. And I'm ignoring everyone around me. I feel like I should not have come to this phone banking/revolutionary dinner event (<--this is the exact friend bonding thing I love and I'm ruining it for myself).
I'm here right now and I am messaging you. 
Clearly I have a problem.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you for writing your response. Things almost immediately got better after Tuesday?s message to you and my self-seclusion at the dinner. Shawn, who is just naturally (I question the word ?natural? every time I say it?¦so I should probably go with ?he?s so well practiced?) good at including people, made a hilarious pun/joke about a person we don?t know who made a accusatory FB comment we all knew about. I swear I think that?s all it took. Somehow that joke was also applied to me, which was extra hilarious as well. I?ll tell you the joke if we ever talk on the phone! Haha
----------- I really think that was the beginning of the funk being pulled out of me. Yesterday I road my bike to a toastmasters meeting that another political friend convinced me to join (I had been a part of their MeetUp group for years and had never gone). It was a nice 9-mile ride. First time I had done any sort of exercise in weeks, probably (may have just been a week, but it was a loooong week). I also didn?t just eat whatever was around me because it was easy or free. I worked a full day yesterday and I actually finally finished a schedule that should meet all demands (this is something I?ve been working on for almost a month now). Therefore I feel extra good today. I don?t feel extra good like crazy happy or anything. I feel extra good like a weight off my shoulders and like I made something that should be implemented for everyone I work with. I feel I really made a fair schedule considering the unfair parameters I was given. Now it?s just a matter of my station manager realizing this and using the bid I?ve been working on so diligently (mostly off hours too). 
------------- Another idea I had when reflecting on how I feel differently: I finished a very political book This Changes Everything by Naomi Klein on Monday. On Tuesday, even though this was still a funk-infested day, I was more sad than angry and I started a new audio book ?Do YOU do It, or Does IT do You?? by Alan Watts. I?m not a Buddhist, but listening to him talk and the things he talks about has dramatically dropped my road rage. I loved Naomi Klein?s book, but I it was truly night and day with my emotional rage during that book versus Alan Watts?. I noticed it immediately. So, not sure it has anything to do with my attitude outside the car, but the timing is also pretty much spot on.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"p.s. I just did the first emotional track. I don't like the emotional options. Definitely didn't give me the options I feel like I have. There also isn't an ""other"" option. That may make the study more difficult, but I think it makes it better. ...I understand Paul Ekman's study of facial expressions with emotions...or maybe I don't...I really feel there are non-universal emotions. So...I might struggle with this section of the study.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I still don't have internet at my place...which is slightly positive because it forces me out of the house, but it is also less ""efficient"" in the sense that I can't just 'get things done whenever'. That could also be looked at as a positive because then I just fell asleep last night. 
-------- I know this is about eating and body image, and, interestingly enough I'm becoming more aware of how much I actually think about my body and almost micro-""negging"" myself everytime I eat anything non-vegetation. -------- Last night my friend asked if I were available at 8:30 this morning to check out a car that he wanted to probably purchase via Craigslist. Today is my only ""off"" day and it's not even an off day. I am fighting a UTI with stomach-churning amounts of water and unsweetened cranberry juice. But I said I'd help out. As ""payment"" he offered brunch. Fine, I guess. It's another way to connect and spend more time with a friend, right? And any ""future payment"" is quickly forgotten (not that I'm looking for payment, but more of an excuse to hang and build a better friendship). I didn't get the french toast like I was struggling to say no to in my head (I love french toast, but I also no sugar is no bueno when fighting a UTI and I'm trying to not eat crap). But I allow for flexibility and get the potatoes with my cheese-less veggie scramble. However, they really recommended the biscuit after I already gave myself the flexibility to have the potatoes...but I already said no to three other things...so I said yes. I ate the whole thing. That doesn't qualify as a binge, but as I looked at my empty plate I thought to myself ""well there's another binge after I was doing so well."" After my friend dropped me off back at home (he bought the car, but they're going to replace the tires first, so he ended up not needing me to drive his old car back) I rode my bike to the gym. On the ride to the gym I got so pissed off because my Spotify premium expired and I, for the first time since owning Spotify (like before it was even introduced to the US...I know I sound like a hipster name-dropper right now) got to listen to how F-ing long the commercials are. Mega first world problems. I was also pissed because my HALF off day was spent doing shit that I didn't plan for - helping a friend that didn't need my help! Which I'm beating myself up for not knowing the future (that he ended up not needing my help). 
-------------- There are two points to this story: 1. I am too flexible in some areas in life and yet terribly not flexible enough in other areas and I don't know how to handle it. 2. I am recognizing that I'm much more angry and agitated when I don't have time...but I'm also unproductive when I'm not pressured. There's a serious Goldilocks-sweet-spot for me. 3. This isn't a point so much as an afterthought: I think I need routine for a while. Haven't had it in a long time...My habits are all out of wack. I'm over spontaneity all the time. Spontaneity all the time isn't spontaneity; it's the same chaos; it turns into a routine of non-routine. Does that make sense? I'm over it. I want to make meals for myself (haven't had time in ages), I want to sleep in my own bed instead of crashing at friend's or coworker's places that are closer to work or an event that's happening the next day (what I'm about to do tonight).",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I didn't include that brunch because I hadn't eaten anything all day and my emotions while eating weren't ""what else can I eat?!"" After I saw the plate completely empty and felt a full stomach I thought to myself ""great. I binged."" Though, I knew I really hadn't gone off the deep end with that brunch.

It was an ?end of summer? celebration. They catered huge amounts of ribs, fried chicken, pig baked beans, pig collard greens, and corn bread. I was so pissed. I was also really hungry. We both know how terrible that combo is. I knew how terrible the combo was in the moment too. But I didn?t have any other options. I had to ?take a lunch,? but not enough time to leave the airport to get something and come back. PLUS, there were, no kidding, dozens of catered trays of crap. ?Soul food? is exactly that: food to stop the body for your soul to free. Point being, I very rarely vomit. I went through a period years ago, but quickly noticed it was messing with my throat (my throat/larynx is sensitive to say the least?¦it may have something to do with my history of being loud).

My stomach was churning after eating that food. I would never choose to have that food around me. It's a bummer that all that food will be wasted one way or another (there will be leftovers for days...and then it will be thrown out).

,,,,"Just to clarify, I did not describe myself as ?beautiful.? After looking at the adjectives I felt as if I do fit the last four ? tall, American, white, and female. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and that dude probably gets stupidly beautiful women all over him. Also, if he was dancing with my best friend ? not in a sexual way, but just a group dancing together ? he was probably into her, until he saw her wedding band?¦and that piece of metal probably wouldn?t stop him from testing the waters anyway. There?s definite history of my insecurity against my Jen (my long established ?bestie?). I?m very insecure with her. She?s extremely attractive in a unique way. I?m very ?all-American? looking. Bland. 80% of white women could be a relative of mine ? that?s how much I don?t have any defining ?hotness?. Little House on The Prairie: I grew up watching this?¦I basically have the same genes and upbringing as them. It?s only when I had a white faux-hawk that I felt unique. Even then I knew full-well that it was my hair that made me stick out. I had pride in my hair back in the day. Now I don?t die my hair?¦bleaching it for 7 years did a number on me. I really love white hair though. I wish I could be ?different?. I wish I has an exotic-looking face. Big eyes, square jaw. But I don?t. I could be Paul Newman?s daughter. He?s got a great personality and that?s what makes him attractive (rip). But he?s got small eyes and an oval face. I think my personality is pretty great (modestly speaking, of course :D), and therefore could be in the Newman family. But I?m broke, I?m not a famous anything, and I?m not a prima donna material girl. Therefore, the likelihood of getting rich or fame is near null.
How has this affected me with past relationships? 
I like to question everything, debate a lot, date dudes that are in love with me, and not just maybe sorta kinda into me. I seriously have nothing bad to say about any of my ex-boyfriends. They?re all really great people. I think I have good taste. Haha. And I was attracted to them too?¦the ones that are much more aesthetically ?dreamboat,? were the ones that lacked the kind of personality that would mesh really well with mine?¦except one. And we were together for over 4 years and it was very long distance after the first 6 months, so?¦for many reasons it didn?t work out. And I know this part may sound shitty, but I did kind of wish (and still kind of do) wish that I fell for someone who wasn?t white. Haha?¦There was only one Black dude I dated that I really felt like we were too young to really fall?¦we were in different places, mentally. But I still think he?s a great person, and he has a super hot girlfriend for, I think, going on 6 years. Other than that, the Black dudes I would really like to date are not going to be into me?¦because they?re political and love the Black culture and Black body, and see my heritage as part of the problem ? and they?re not wrong. Which means, I?m really good at setting myself up for failure: if you?re not politically engage you?ll like me (because society has deemed white women as a status symbol for Black men), but I won?t like you because you don?t know that and I can feel the sex-pedestal creeping.

He's on anti-depressants/anti-anxiety medication which, I'm not sure if it makes a difference, but it really feels like he's just sort of bland. He got contentious over something I said that he misunderstood and then I misunderstood his misunderstanding (haha). It didn't bother me much. What bothered me was that he took that moment to mean something bigger than what it was: a moment. He doesn't like to get ""angry"" (honestly it wasn't anger as much as it was a raised voice and annoyance). It's nice that he doesn't like to get angry but he's seriously overly worried about becoming angry. Emotions are emotions and if he wants to stifle one, I think the collateral damage is that he ends up stifling most of not all of them. So...he doesn't tell me he likes me. Pretty much ever. And I am a words person. I want words. I want actions to support the words, definitely. But words! And he is a touch/affection kind of guy. I am not into PDA. So...we've had talks.

Making subtle (but obvious) jokes about it. If there's something to disagree on I'll make a bet on ""a burrito and a love letter in the mail"" (he owes me 3!!).

His response to when I bring up the debt he has (burritos and love letters) he's like ""well I can't do it now that you're reminding me because now it's expected."" He's also said, ""you already have a note by your bed"" (this was when he stayed over and I had to work at 5am. He left a short cute note on my bed when I got back and he had gone to the lab. He hasn't even paid up on the burrito front (he's taken me out for other meals). After the serious sit downs he doesn't say much. He's not making excuses or defending himself but he's also not saying he'll use his words more either.

It doesn't have to be 'I like you,' but it has to be with words. If it feels fake, fight through it anyway. If it is fake, then kindly stop dating me.""

So 2 out of 7 days is a start... when I write it out I'm annoyed. It's annoying that he's all about the touching (kissing, holding hands, arms wrapped around, cuddling [which I like cuddling, but it's terrible for sleeping, so he's been nice enough to cuddle me less so I can actually sleep]).

I know the other two well-enough to consider them friends (but only through my dude). I made them an Xmas card and I wore my fav old thrift Xmas sweater.

When I did the compassion technique/lesson today my first reaction was that I was oozing compassion. Then I read the story about walking fast to a meeting I was running. That made me remember plenty of times that I didn?t pullover to help people when I was going to work. One time I remember very specifically not pulling over to ask if the driver of a truck just stopped in the middle of the road needed help because I was so mad that traffic was so terrible during a time that should have been wide open. I probably needed to get home for something, but by me spending 10-15 minutes helping this person move their broken down truck, I could have saved hundreds of other people 30-60 minutes and the earth gazillions of stopped traffic carbon emissions. I?m still annoyed with myself for that. Anyway, that moment is beside the point. The next prompt asked me to identify which category I would like to be more compassionate with. I knew I needed to be more compassionate with my mom. I?m usually critical of most anything she says. When I closed my eyes I already could see how uncompassionate I had been (and still am) for so long. I?ve ?hated? her on some level since I was 13. I cried all over this tutorial. The letting go portion was oddly soothing and understandable as well. Maybe because I had that ?take a step back? voice to address the side I already have, which is ?all those tears are for the past, but you can do something differently right now and moving forward.? So it was easy to stop crying. For a long time I have said, somewhat proudly, that I?m a really great audience member. I can feel and express whatever emotion the commercial, band, or lecturer is trying to convey. I feel like during this exercise my audience skills were extremely heightened. Could be the period thing. Who knows. Anyhow. That?s what happened and right now my mom has 4 compressed fracture vertebrates and the beginnings of osteoporosis. Therefore I am making a card to send her today (and I honestly have a picture on my phone of a bullet point list of treating a compression fracture of the back. I highlighted the bullet point that said ?physical therapy to help strengthen your core muscles and spinal support muscles?. She?s overweight and I have very consistently harassed her about being more active. I wasn?t looking to give her a list of treatments to help her, I was looking to justify my position and backhand blame her for the pain that she?s in.

Hot Tamales candy yesterday (like a lot...after a long workout and dinner...which is annoying that I ruined such a good workout day.

I just kept popping things in my mouth while working on this program for an assignment that I've never worked on before. As much as it was mindless it was consciously mindless, if that makes sense. I knew what I was doing and I kept telling myself to stop and then would then go grab another handful).

Now it's super awkward and he was at a meeting we had all just come from today and that's the first time I had seen him since an awkward moment where I dropped off a card to him on his birthday about two weeks ago. We are supposed to be really good friends and he sucks. I was reminded of all of this at the dinner with my friends (I'll just lump the acquaintance in as a friend to keep it easy). Anyway. I'm just bummed that he's a very different person when any amount of ""more than friend"" intimacy comes into play. It's shocking, in fact. In fact I don't believe it's real. It's so night and day that I can't believe it. It also says something about me as well. I date pretty great people. I don't pick shitty guys. This guy is so close to being in that category --and we were pretty good friends for a solid 7 months prior-- that it's nearly unbelievable. So I'm personally offended that I didn't see this, seriously contradicting, side to him. So I ate some fries and had half a milkshake. I don't even think it's the food anymore.

When I restrict, it usually comes back to bite me after a few days. However, I can commit to certain things. I committed to the Whole30 a while back because I wanted to start and finish something that was a definite program that other people have done. When I try to commit to something I make up myself, it's a lot easier to fall out of the habit because I don't have a role model to look at and no one to hold me accountable. Does that make sense?

When I get to said place, I'm already super conflicted, but I've subconsciously already made up my mind that I'm going to have that thing, and then I need more after that because I feel like I failed. It like sneaks up on me, and by the time I get to it, my mind has been made up and I can only control it after the damage has been done.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey Katie! I had another thing I should let you in on. Yesterday I had a lot of Crunch bars that were just sitting in my room. Lately when I've been having a lot of junk food, I've been feeling sick to my stomach. I never used to eat junk food like candy bars. Yesterday I felt sick to the point where I almost felt like I could make myself throw up if I wanted. It was a very scary thought. I didn't do it, and I don't think I would have, but when I talked to Blake about it, he was definitely concerned. I thought I should let you know about that.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"They do have a 'menu' scheduled weekly, but sometimes I have either no idea what it is, or they stray from the original menu. I like knowing what I am having for sure. Yesterday I went to the dining hall with a friend and I just got a normal meal, like an average sized, not too big meal. I feel more prepared when I have where I am going planned out for the day, and then it just depends on where I'm going for what I'm going to get. If I'm with the right people I think I can manipulate it to my advantage, but I do think it would be wise to look at the dining hall menus ahead of time.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"In the long run, 16 months isn't going to be that long. It's the change in relationship status and the fact that I can't text my best friend every day that's so weird. I'm really hoping the awkward phase goes by quickly.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you; it's my pleasure! I just refused to get up and do it. I was more in shock that the thought existed than anything else. I talked to Blake the next day, yesterday, about it. I'll be checking out dining hall menus in the meantime. :) I should also let you know that Blake and I broke up last night. We both came to the conclusion that we are very different people with different goals, and since we've worked together through things for so long, we were holding on more for the sake of the relationship than because we'd be good together for the rest of our lives. We're on good terms; it's just so weird. I feel a bit numb, and I don't really know how to handle it. I'm just kind of doing my own thing. Nothing bad has happened. I don't feel an urge to binge at all. It's almost as if a weight has been lifted off of me, which sounds bad, but it's the truth. I guess we'll see where this takes me.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I appreciate it. Yeah, I've been focusing more on my relationship with God now that I feel like it's way more of a priority. I think my other relationship was beginning to keep me from that, which is funny because it was supposed to be the foundation of the relationship. I've also gotten closer to my friends here at college. Yes, he is still at college with me. I saw him driving his car for Jimmy Johns today... that was awkward. I'm sure it will get better; I can see us still being great friends and everything. I want to continue this program; I think it will still be very useful. I'll just have different kinds of entries and methods of venting in the real world. :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey Katie! So sorry for not responding; the past few days have been hectic with catching up with homework and stuff. Boredom eating is the feeling like I gotta have food while I'm doing something because what else would I do? Like popcorn and homework. I don't get as much homework done when I do that, but I guess it's a thing. Also, yesterday I started my new medication. I have felt super calm and focused yesterday and today so far. Every time I start to worry about something, something snaps back into place and I think, ""Why am I worried? Will it help? Is there a reason to be worried? Nah, just take it one step at a time."" I HAVE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE, so that was a huge shocker to me. I'm happy with it so far, and now that I've started getting my life back in control (kinda sorta maybe), I can work on this program more!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Update: Not doing super well. Past couple days on the medication have been weird. I'm kind of back to normal, but I am feeling SUPER depressed tonight. I'm not sure what caused this, but I don't know how to handle it.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Awesome! If you don't mind me asking, of all the people who sign up for the program, how many actually end up completing it? I'm just curious. Yeah! Oh my goodness, the past couple days have been wonderful. I think it's super funny that I'm going through the emotion regulation section right now, because I feel like I'm regulating my emotions more than ever with this. It's absolutely amazing, and I never realized how... not anxious... how calm life can be even in the middle of the storm. The storm isn't that bad once you can wrap your mind around things and realize it's only a little rain, and that can be healthy.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Oh, no worries! I phoned a friend and she talked to me for a while. ""Have been weird"" as in suddenly I had the urge to eat more food when the few days beforehand had been so easy to manage. Also the feelings of depression and having no value kicked in. Last night it reached a point where I was contemplating the worst thing I could possibly do, if you get the hint, and I just thought, ""What the actual heck,"" because that isn't normal. Talking to my friend helped, but it just hurt to be bombarded so suddenly with thoughts like that. If you are spiritual in any way, I strongly believe in the power of prayer. If not, thoughts and the continuation of letting me vent on here works! :D This holds me accountable for holding myself together.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I am a bit frustrated because I keep telling myself I'm going to contact her, and then I either forget or feel like my schedule can't fit it. I think I'm going to do what I had to do for the gym: schedule the phone call. That would relieve a lot of anxiety. Also, I want to let you know that this weekend I will be going on a trip with a group here at UCM, so I may not be able to access this program. If I am, I'll try my best to find time to get it done.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It's going wonderful! I got back yesterday, and was sooo tired. I feel like the medication is beginning to stabilize, because I'm only having cravings I can control. I don't feel the urge to eat a whole lot more than I need. Over the weekend I kind of felt bad about my body and was comparing myself, but not as much as I have been. It was a comfortable atmosphere, and I was more distracted by what was going on than myself.",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey! Sorry, I got distracted with a lot of stuff and forgot to respond. I appreciate all of that, and will probably be calling Tammy soon. I think the medication is going to be fluctuating until it stabilizes in my body, and I'm willing to go through that if it helps in the end.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I actually just saved that website into my bookmarks; thank you! I'm going to try that. And I just texted Tammy, so hopefully she gets back to me soon. I suggested a call next week just because there is a lot going on within the next few days. And thanks; you too! OH YOU ARE GETTING MARRIED THIS WEEKEND, AREN'T YOU??? Have a WONDERFUL time! Don't stress, and just enjoy it! You got this. :)",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"You're so welcome! :D Thank you so much, will do! And thank you, it turned out well. :)",,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hahaha, I know, right? Yes, I really enjoy the readings. A lot of it was familiar, and reminders are always super helpful, but some of it was also new information and new tactics. After reading them I feel a little bit better about myself. I like how honest and kindly blunt this program is.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I haven't tried too much over the weekend, but I kinda did without the program. I've lost a bit of weight, so I did spend about 10 or 15 minutes checking for any flaws. Does that count? Haha",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I guess I had to think about it a bit longer and just keep telling myself that I'm being irrational. I also kind of told myself that I shouldn't care what others think as long as I'm still doing my best to be a good sane person. Haha, sorry about that. Next time I'll try to see it that way and not focus on that.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thanks!! It's been a lot easier. Although, yesterday wasn't super easy. I just began my time of the month, though, so that might be why I'm craving certain foods. Yeah, last week I just wasn't hungry for dinner. One of the days I decided I wasn't going to because I knew I wouldn't have time, so I didn't worry about it. It helped me focus on other things. I still ate throughout the day and over the weekend, but not nearly as much as I have before and maybe almost not enough.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"She is such a dear, and I couldn't be more grateful. That video is SO good!!! It kind of sounds ridiculous coming from someone else. I wouldn't look at them in that way, so why should I look at myself in that way? These thoughts are terrible, gah. I really liked the cognitive reframing exercise. I actually felt less anxious afterwards. I'm still anxious, but I know I'm over exaggerating my worst fears. It puts the situation into perspective, kind of like how that video showed how ridiculous these comments were when said from another person. It reminds me of a song called, ""Die, Vampire, Die!"" from the musical, ""[title of show]"". You can look up the song or lyrics if you'd like, but I'll warn you that it has a lot of profanity. I don't usually listen to music with a lot of profanity, but oh man, this message is great. At the end it has this entirely relatable ""vampire"" that we all have: ""The last vampire is the mother of all vampires and that is the vampire of despair.
It?ll wake you up at 4am to say things like:
Who do you think you?re kidding?
You look like a fool.
No matter how hard you try, you?ll never be good enough
Why is it that if some dude walked up to me on the subway platform 
and said these things, I?d think he was a mentally ill asshole, 
but if the vampire inside my head says it, 
It?s the voice of reason.""
It has such an uplifting message, and while you may not be able to recommend it to others due to its content, I think you'll understand why I love it so much.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I don't actually remember what I wrote down last time; I'm sorry! I'm sure it was fine in the end, though. I've been alone all weekend, and it has been very interesting. I had a dream last night where I couldn't see. I could only see in one general direction, but when I tried to do something like walk, run, or pick something up, I couldn't look that way. I woke up terrified because of the events of the dream, and I started having very negative thoughts about myself. Not about my body image exactly, but more about my self-worth. I knew it wasn't right to be thinking that way, but it was still scary to be there. I've been alone all day besides church this morning, but I haven't done anything stupid. I have been cleaning, but I haven't gotten much homework done. I also did laundry, so that was productive. I haven't eaten today yet, but I think that's just because I'm not hungry. I'm not thinking, ""I need to restrict this, I can't eat."" I just simply don't want to because I don't feel like I need to. I'm not sure if that is a normal thing or not, so I thought I would let you know about it. I hope your weekend has been delightful!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I think as time goes on and I learn to manage everything better those situations will improve. I normally just talk with them for a little bit and if they are going out, stay behind. I was alone all weekend because my roommate and suitemates went on a trip together that I couldn't go on because I was helping out with a surprise party. They were a-okay with this, but I still felt bad. I didn't eat on Sunday, no. I just did homework, got tired, and went to bed. It's not that it didn't occur to me or I was restricting, I simply didn't feel the need to eat. I didn't binge the next day, but I did eat a little extra because I didn't eat on Sunday. This morning I was watching Netflix and binged a little, but that wasn't because of Sunday. I shouldn't have been watching Netflix and eating right before heading to work. I went to my psychiatrist yesterday, and we doubled my dosage of Wellbutrin, the medication I am on. It was the next dosage up, so it was the only option. I took it this morning, and don't feel that much of a difference yet. I'll have to wait and see if this is what I needed.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"My hunger and anxiety definitely have some correlation, but I'm not for certain about causation. I'm finding I'm not binging because I'm anxious anymore, but when I start eating I get afraid I won't stop. I turn my common sense ""off"" and just go at it. I've definitely been more loose about things lately and letting a lot slide, but my psychiatrist said that was normal for someone who used to have a LOT of anxiety. It is what drove me, and now I have to find new methods of motivation and self-control.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Not a FULL day, but I've had a couple that were the majority. I might consider doing that again, at least for breakfasts or lunches. Dinners are almost always unpredictable. Thank you for reminding me of that, though!!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Awesome! Thanks for giving me a heads up! I wasn't sure was happens after this, so that's wonderful to hear! I've been feeling pretty good. The first few days of doubling my medication I had migraines and was dizzy, but now I feel much more calm and collected. I'm not sure if it is better than before, but it sure feels like it!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey! I didn't do much on Halloween. I did Chemistry homework, haha! I also didn't have a lot of candy. Yes, I remember last summer I gave up certain foods because they were unhealthy, but then I reverted back to eating them. That's a very broad instance, and I know we've covered stuff like that before. I can't think of another specific instance, but I know I don't realize I've slipped back into the habit until it has happened a few times. I'll make a decision that leads to it, feel guilty, and won't even notice when I start doing it again. If I catch myself, I usually try to find a distraction. In the past, a lot of distractions were food, but that in itself became an issue. Sometimes I'll talk to someone, or I'll try and stop the feelings as they come.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Tammy actually hasn't contacted me again, and I'm thinking she probably forgot. I've just been nervous to say anything again, even though I know that's a stupid thought. I might text her this weekend. Patience is definitely not my best quality, but I've been much better about it with people. Also, patience with myself and staying calm about it has been pretty good. I definitely still have the effects of depression (just the feeling of being sad and not knowing what to do about it), but while I may not be happy sometimes, I still know I have joy, and that's what really matters. Yay! Thank you so much!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Awesome! Thanks for letting me know! And thank you. :) I am feeling a lot better. I've started doing more intense workouts (starting more weights and strength training), so I've felt good about that. All food has come down to is self-control. I don't feel that terrible urge that consumes me, but I am still attempting to gain control of a new motivation. Other than that, I'm great! (also, stressful week. BUT that goes to show that I'm handling it very well!) I have texted Tammy. I haven't received a response quite yet, but I hope to soon!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"It went well! She was grateful for the help. I've definitely been praying a whole lot for the incentive to get things done. I think the fact that I know I need to do things by a certain time is getting to me a lot better now. I've never been a procrastinator, so it's just been weird. I'm glad it's getting better. Honestly? A lot has been happening. Little circumstances pop up and change my whole mindset for the rest of the day, and then I start to feel so much better. Today, for no reason, I looked in the mirror and began thinking about critical things, but suddenly I started thinking, ""You're beautiful."" And this voice kept ringing in my head over and over, ""You are so beautiful,"" and I cried for a long time and still had those thoughts ringing. I've never been able to look at myself and just think that without other thoughts coming with it. Tammy still hasn't contacted me back, but I will keep you updated!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey! So sorry for not responding for a while; I didn't have much computer access over break and finals are driving me up a wall. I don't have an iPhone, so I've only been using computers for this (usually at work). I had a really good break, but I didn't get a whole lot of rest. I hope you had a good Thanksgiving, too!!!",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi, Katie!! Sorry I haven't been on here in a while. Finals and the holidays got crazy, and I totally forgot. School starts up again on Monday, so I'll be on my computer much more often. To answer your question, I don't have to take chemistry ever again, which makes me very happy. I do want to make sure I still know the basics, though, in case I need it for future classes. With physiology, I know I'll be applying that information. Anyways, I hope you had a wonderful holiday!! :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"By the way, my final grades ended up being all A's and one B (Chemistry, haha), and I am so overjoyed by it.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Nope, I tend to commit when I start something! Awww, I'm really glad you liked it! Some of these questions are very fun to answer. They keep my mind active and alert about what's happened that day. Thanks so much! Food has been... interesting. I have binged maybe once or twice in the last 4 weeks of break, but finals week was just BAD. I wasn't binging, but when I had a meal, I went all out. I made this thing called a ""Party Waffle"" for breakfast. Basically, you take the normal waffle batter in one cup, have another cup with chocolate chips, oreo bits, and rainbow sprinkles, and spread that out into the waffle maker as you pour the batter. After it is done, smother it with cream cheese and maple syrup. Healthy, right? My stomach hurt so much after those days. I haven't been eating desserts at home, only when I'm out (like for Christmas and New Years parties). I will be doing great for a few days, but like today, sometimes I'll be home alone and I'll raid the fridge or cabinet for some carbs. I'll admit I've been depriving myself from the majority of carbs whenever I can. I've been focusing more on proteins, and when I crave a bagel or something, I shove a protein shake down my throat and end up eating two bagels the next day or something. Binging to the extent of depression hasn't been as prevalent, but boy, sometimes I still feel like a failure. My weight has stopped bothering me as much, at least the number. Now it's more about how I feel, and how I fit into things (which has still been going on for a while, but the number has also been mind-consuming). I've been keeping up with my diary, still, so I've had a place to write down my thoughts and kind of figure out what the heck is going through my mind. Oh wow, I just realized this message is super long. Anyways, I've found it much easier to say no to desserts as long as there is healthy food, and when there isn't really healthy food prepared, I tend to go more for a lot of bad foods, if that makes sense. At least I've noticed a difference in my muscles over the last few weeks!!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Thank you so much! I've definitely recognized it at this point. It actually happened last night at a farewell party for one of my friends, haha. I overate a lot of sugary foods I normally wouldn't have. Something I've been afraid of is having similar problems as a recovering alcoholic. What I mean by that is that a recovering alcoholic can't have ""just one"" drink. There is no ""just one,"" and that is kind of how it is for me with sweets. If I have a cookie, I want all the cookies. Someone gives me a box of truffles? Maybe I'll eat two, realize what's happening, and then try to give the rest away to people, but it is very difficult to do. I do love whole grains and wheat over white bread. I would prefer something really dark, dense, and nutty over something that is white, fluffy, and sugary. Normal college students just don't seem to eat like that, so it's hard to find that option. And about the email thing, no worries at all! I was concerned because you're right, I wasn't receiving the emails, but I'm not upset at all. The only thing is that the emails saying that you messaged me are a great reminder to come back here, because I've become kind of immune to the ""tracking"" emails. I know I set them for a time I think works for me, but I'm always busy doing something and end up just not doing it. The message emails are great because I feel more held accountable, and I like that.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"That does make sense. I have found that going to the library to study helps control my cravings rather than being in the dorm room. The only problem so far is the cold weather, and the ice storm is not going to help with that. I'm a bit nervous because tomorrow I have a psychiatric appointment about 45 minutes away tomorrow, and since I found out about the ice storm a few hours ago, it was too late to cancel. It's at about 12:30, so I'm just going to get there as soon as possible and hope they let me in early. And thank you so much, I was nervous I wrote too much in the body tracking! I got slightly off-topic, but I love to just write (or type) because it helps me organize my thoughts so much better. Although it is frightening to go through my old OneNote diary entries from when I was bulimic. I actually feel super uncomfortable when I do that.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey Katie! I've discovered that 18 credit hours is much more difficult than I thought it was going to be. I am working so much. I love it, don't get me wrong, I love being busy. But holy moly, this is a lot of stuff to do and keep track of.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I do still have a lot of work, but I am managing it all very well. Better than I thought I would, actually! I am more focused on my studies, but I've made room for a social life (I kind of cheated the system by using group things already planned out as my hangout time, and then hanging out with people at the times I normally eat, so I get two things done at one time).",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hi Katie! I am doing well. Life is really crazy. I have my next psychiatry appointment tomorrow where we will discuss the medications I am currently on.

I feel a lot more confident and intelligent with what I am doing.",,,,,none,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey Katie! I wanted to let you know that my psychiatrist prescribed me with an ADHD medication that is approved for individuals who struggle with binge-eating. I have been on it for about two days now, and I have definitely felt its effects in a hyper way. I am more focused. Today hasn't been the best day to actually see how it works because I have been in my dorm doing homework, and couldn't go to work because I am sick. I will update you on what happens with it. :) I am a bit nervous.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hey Katie! I know I keep apologizing for not responding, but I'm going to keep doing it because I am sorry. I'll update you on what's up! I stopped taking the medication because it was making it difficult to sleep, and I was having very vivid dreams. Binge eating has been so much better, and I've actually given up gluten for lent. Well, more just fasting (I'm not Catholic). It's actually doing me a lot of good because I've been to a LOT of events with sweets and stuff that have gluten in them that I would normally binge on, but because I am doing this as a fast with people holding me accountable, I haven't really had much temptation about it. I had spring break last week, and it went well! I had some allergy issues, but overall it was good. My relationship with my family is definitely improving, and mom and I went on a women's retreat with a church. That was time to reflect over our relationship, and I'm finding that I do care a lot more about her now, and I've warmed up, but there is still a tiny bit of disdain that I know should not be there. It was affecting me almost the entire trip. I lost a few pounds, but I am not focusing on that. I've gained more since I last told you my weight, so I'm probably closer to the last weight I told you, haha. Holy cow, weights have done me so good. The exercise classes and weights I have been doing are so wonderful. The classes hold me accountable, and I love having the muscle I am getting! It really is wonderful. I found some more stretch marks, but I'm getting a lot better at dealing with them. I feel like I am going to be very uncomfortable this summer, though. I don't know if my shorts fit me, and I definitely do not want to swim. That is worrying me. School is pretty good, though. I just got back today. I hope you have been doing well! Again, I apologize for slacking. I hate excuses, but a lot of it is anxiety. I have it with texting, too. When I get a notification saying that someone has messaged me, I have this fear of needing to respond immediately. It's actually caused some problems in my life. The one thing I am really careful about is work messages. Usually those aren't stressful, though (which is funny). Anyways, have a great day whenever you read this! Thanks for still responding to me and stuff. :) I really appreciate it!!!",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,

,,,,"Hey Katie, yeah I do a weekly meal plan but not necessarily a meal tracking of what all I eat throughout each day. I have tried to before and, like you said, it can be challenging to do on a regular basis. With my meal plan, I have a solid sketch for my breakfast, lunch, and dinner. However, I tend to struggle with what to eat in between meals as well as night time snacking. I tend to go for a granola bar if I go back to the gym after work to play basketball. At night, I been eating Special K protein cereal with sliced bananas and skim milk. It tends to fill me up and I haven't been anything else when I eat that at night. Is that an okay snack type? What are good, healthy snacks to eat in between meals?
Thank you!

,,,,The Green Tea Fat Burner extract I get is from Walmart for like $10,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"No worries Katie! I had a pretty good weekend, hope yours was the same. Thank you for the feedback. Yeah, I've been taking Green Tea Fat Burner gel pills for about a month now. I've read some articles that says green tea helps with weight loss as long as you work out. However, I've also heard that diet pills do not necessarily result in weight loss or fat burning. I also like taking this because its cheap but mainly because It gives me energy in the morning and afternoon with the caffeine in it. I've notice I am a little more awake when I do take it in the morning in comparison to days when I don't. I take two pills in the morning and two in the late afternoon right before dinner. It helps me give an extra energy boost after dinner when I do my homework so I'm not feeling sluggish after the long day. What are your thoughts on green tea extracts, or diet pills in general? Thanks, Ben.",,,,,none,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I found the session interesting. I went through a certain phase when I was a freshman in high school and would barely eat breakfast, dont eat a lunch, and just ate dinner. I realized this stored calories for the time of days I wouldn't eat and it was obvious it was not a healthy diet. With me today, i love food too much to do that so i don't have a problem with that, it is just a struggle with eating healthier and not binging at night. I thought the forbidden fruit concept was quite interesting and it has definitely happen to me before with oreos.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,

I have done some self-care activities before but perhaps I should give it another try. one activity I did for like a week was taking an Epsom salt bath at night. I felt that it was relaxing and something I enjoyed. I just went away from doing so because school started and usually use the night to do homework or just sit on the couch and watch tv for maybe thirty minutes.

I have a YMCA membership since January and have been there twice... not good! Also, I am a student at a university with a terrific recreation center... not been there yet. I do not understand why I am not taking the time or making the effort to do exercise daily... I feel this is very important but have not done so. Also, as you mentioned in your messages, my diet could be much more regular. I have noticed a transition has happened over the past 4 weeks while on the road and upon returning home, I find that I am not buying so much food to keep the fridge stocked like before. In fact, as I want something to eat, I look into an almost bare refrigerator... then, I try to decide what to eat and where. So, I end up going out and looking for something that might satisfy my appetite. I am completely open to suggestions in this area and feel that I am at a very impressionable turning point, capable to taking your advise on this issue. Thank you again for all you help :) Brad",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Yes Anna, I did try it out some but have not put it on my iPhone yet so it makes the process a bit of a bother to go online and add the items... Plus, I am not very disciplined and have difficulty with that. I am wanting to add some exercise so I will have more energy and not gain so much weight too.",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I am, but the last week s have been very difficult. My son who lives in NewOrleans was gone and nobody knew how to reach him. His work said he did not come in for two weeks, he was not at home, all his things were left untouched, his phone was not used (all since the 10th of October) so we even checked the jails and hospitals... nothing. We finally found him and he is safe... not the best thing but at least not what we feared. So, anyway that was a tough few weeks. Yes, I'm back and ready to move forward. Thank you for your patience.

,,,,"I am maintaining a downward movement in weight (7 lbs less than two weeks ago). Currently staying around the 235 mark. I have been strong and staying away from the breads over the past week or so. I have not binged in a long time. I even give away the fattening items I buy at the store spontaneously to a friend with kids who is struggling so it helps us both :) Don't worry, I'm not causing them to be overweight, they're all pretty much under weight. He said he can never gain weight. Anna, thank you for not giving up on me even though you didn't hear from me for a while. I have also been getting more active but I am still having difficulty in tracking as I should.

,,,,Thank you... getting ready for finals week and the holidays. Happy Thanksgiving Anna :),,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,Thank you Anna. I did have a terrific holiday season and hope you did as well. I am about to start my next semester in a few days and can feel the stress mounting as I will be starting my Thesis. I am grateful that the program is still available and will attempt to get into a good routine of working this program into my schedule over the next four months.,,,,,positive,,,,,,,,
,,,,"I generally eat two meals per day with snacks in between. But I think the problem is as much what I eat as how much I eat because it is usually on the go and involves bread or sweets, or a combination of both :(",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"it seems to be when I am about to get on the road and I kind of try to use my time efficiently since I drive 90 miles each way to school three days per week and my classes are at the Grad level which is pretty overwhelming. I am moving this weekend to get closer to school to help in that area, and give myself some stress relief from driving so far on those days :)",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,"That is a very good idea Anna. I will schedule the time when I fist get up and check my email every morning and see if that will help me. Thank you. I have been drinking much more water. I am not at the 8X8 level yet, but I am much better than before. I use to never drink water. I have replaced sodas with water for the most part now. Thank you :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna :)
Thank you for reaching out. I have been going through a bit of hell lately trying to get on pace to complete my thesis this summer. It is wicked hard and I have not even slept for the past 36 hours but I think you deserve to hear from me since you have remained faithful to me. I will try very hard to get with you this Sunday after I get this one part of my thesis complete. When I get this part done I will be able to breath a little. Sorry for being bad :)",,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
,,,,"Hi Anna,
How much time is left in this program for me to use the resources. I do see where it has made me think about things more and that may be helping but I do not have a scale that works and have not checked my weight since I went into the gym at school.",,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,I have been sick with a loss of appetite which has helped me to control myself but sometimes I'm not eating enough I'm starting to gain my appetite back now but it's been a long recovery sorry I'm so awful at replying to you,,,,,negative,,,,,,,,
,,,,I have been carrying food with me and I can do a phone call next week I have Monday and Wednesday from 12-6 open,,,,,mixed,,,,,,,,
