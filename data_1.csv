"Hello Sara, I apologize for having not contacted you. I was sick the past week and schoolwork kicked up as expected after the first month. I'm enjoying the program, even if I haven't been entirely attentive to it. The last exercise involving diaphragmatic breathing is coincidental also something I have been doing a lot in my speech class. The program as a whole is working well the class funnily enough.",mixed
"Well, I have been experiencing enough of low level of depression/anxiety over the past year to consider bring it to a source outside of my typically support group. Between that and enough self-reflection ending in,""maybe I should go back to therapy?......eh"", I decided to start seeking sources and I came upon lantern. I won't bore you with all my secrets now, but if I feel the need to disclose them, I will easily.",mixed
"Hi Sara, I'm doing well. I think it would be best to end my participation in the program as I haven't been able to remain on track with it. I feel as if I did not do the best on my end to keep up with the beta testing and even when I did, I found web-based therapy was not organic to me. Other than that, I thank you and Lantern for your time.",negative

Hi coach! I'm really excited to get going with HBI!,positive
Sure! Didn't expect you to answer right away;) Glad that this works though!,positive
I have struggled with binge/purging on and off. It'll be very present for a few months and then it won't be so much. But I'm always concerned about what I eat. Recently I've been binge eating more and purging slightly less than usual which is contributing to weight gain which is deteriorating my mood.,negative

"hi jacqui thanks for the message. i'm free to talk on tuesday at night. hm yah, i guess i'm more interested in the narrative of food as survival and how that has been passed down to me from my mother, with my parents' background as refugees. growing up, i've been raised to eat whatever i got -- not to really discriminate against taste -- and to finish it all. i noticed now that whenever i'm offered food (especially free food), that's what my mind zooms in on, even if i'm not hungry at all. i just think about the free food and eat as if food won't be available to me for the next meal... it's difficult jacqui. and it's been on my mind constantly.",negative
"hi jacqui, thanks for your sentiment i really appreciate it. hmmmm. well i kinda feel like this is a been there, done that kind of talk for them. and i feel like some of them really won't get it -- ya know? like it may just seem really easy to them to just stop eating so much // connecting so much emotions to food (i.e. today i definitely binge ate from the stress of my midterms!!! and now i'm really back at square -1 since i'm a little ashamed of my escapade). i'm also super self conscious because my belly is starting to pop out a LOT more than before and i know that the fat there is actually a health hazard... idk jacqui i just feel like a lot of negative thoughts are consuming me and i'd just like to be light instead of dark in my head",negative

"Well, I have a paper crafting studio upstairs. I make and sell cards, scrapbook pages, and other gift giving packaging type things. I've been trying to get back into it for months now. All I seem to be able to do is buy supplies and organize them. It's stressful. Today though I am going to work in a project I've been trying to get started on since Monday. I'm just going to put everything aside and start on it. I'm excited..I think :). I'm taking a break from the outside world for today. That's a start.

She is my first real friend in many years. I don't want to upset her. Anyway mostly my self care at this time in my life is sleeping and eating. After I got home today I slept for 3 1/2 hours.

"Hi Winnie,
I'm still trying to figure the site out, it's kind of confusing but I'm sure it's just because everything is new. I would add my picture if I could figure out how. 

Anyway...I decided to give this a try because I'm feeling overwhelmed and it's bringing me down. I've been working with a psychologist for a year now (my first attempt at therapy). I see her once a week and I don't contact her outside of session. I see a psychiatrist too. I started taking zoloft in January. I'm currently at 200mg.

I live with OCD (it sucks, it really does). I guess I've had it since childhood. I've been going to therapy and taking medication for that and PTSD and whatever else is in my file. I'm feeling stuck. I was doing good for a while but now I'm doing all these new things and it's freaking me out.

I'm trying this for added support, to help myself. I feel like I'm failing. Like I can't fix myself no matter how hard I try. 

This is long, sorry. I'm not sure if you even wanted to know any of this..ugh! This is kind of weird for me. 

PS
I don't think my psychologist is doing CBT with me. It's more just talking about my week, feelings, social stuff (because I'm not good at being social) and family relationships.",negative

Thanks so much for the message! Yeah lately the biggest thing I have been having trouble with is restricting. I start to eat and then I just have to stop. I've been losing a lot of weight and I just can't seem to eat enough the voice just says no and I stop. The Mirror Exercise was very difficult and I spent the whole time looking at problem areas.

"Hi Melody- thanks for your note! My Monday has been okay. It was a stressful day academically and I wish that didn't affect my eating behaviors. But otherwise, it's been fine :)
How has yours been?",mixed
"Hey Melody- thanks so much for your note. You're right that it's the academic stress that caused that to happen. When I'm away from school, back home with my family for example, I would never feel the urge to do something like that to myself. Just so you know, I've been much better since Monday- less stressed! Recently I've been much more careful to practice self care. I do yoga a couple times a week (but wish I could do it more) and go to the gym with a girlfriend once a week. I like to spend time with my boyfriend and with my friends to blow off steam :) overall I am quite happy, but when things get hectic and stressful, I do wish I were better at coping! I think the trick is letting myself off the hook, and being kinder to myself in stressful situations. No one is perfect :)",mixed
"Yes- I had a piece of a chocolate bar as a treat and felt guilty about it, so ended up eating the rest of the bar and a couple other bars. I am very ashamed to say that I made myself throw up after that. This only happens a couple times a month and I am seeing a therapist on campus every other week, in the hopes of completely eradicating the purge behavior. I don't have an eating disorder, but every now and then when stressors get to be a lot, my eating patterns (which are usually great) veer towards being disordered.",negative

I hope your dissertation and travel goes well.

I feel that I've made lots of progress! I appreciate that you were with me every step of the way. Thank you for everything you do!",positive
"Good evening! :) thanks for the kind note- that's exactly how they raised me and i am very grateful for it! I hope to teach my own kids flexibility, adaptability and resiliency someday.

"Hi there Melody! Thank you so much! This summer I'm going to be giving campus tours and studying for the MCAT. I'm looking forward to having a fun and relaxing time with family and friends.

I felt much less stressed after that! Hope all is well with you!",positive
Hi Jacqui- I just don't think the meditation techniques are very suitable for my personality. The self-reflection activities (like the one where we are supposed to stare at our body) seem contrived and superficial to me. I am also crunched for time as a college student and these techniques are very time-consuming and I feel like I get little value out of them.,negative
"Anyway, I called my ex Adam, first time we've really had a phone call and I told him I was lonely. The call devolved into talking about the business and all the ways he is disappointed in me; he's basically transitioning out of the business b/c it wasn't growing as quickly as he would like and he's disappointed in me. 
I feel like I can redeem myself - I can take to heart the things he said and fix them. I think maybe at some point I'll be the person he wanted me to be all along - but we'll have both moved on. I don't like the person he's become so I'm not interested in getting back together w/ him. 
Anyway that conversation was sort of a downer, and it will be a while before we can be close friends like we used to be.
Just feeling a little lonely like right now there isn't really anyone who I feel super intimate with. 
Now that A has gone missing, I guess I'll just focus on the other guy I'm seeing, Chris. We're getting together on Wed. 
I don't regret anything that happened, and I know this is a great time to be alone, but sometimes being single kind of sucks!",mixed
"argh, 2 huge boy issues, although I'm actually cranking and getting through my to do list! Actually feeling like there is a light at the end of the tunnel, something I haven't felt in a LONG time.

I sent him this note: 
subject: do you still like me? :-(

11:51 PM (1 hour ago)
I have no idea b/c you're a very sporadic communicator
The on and off communication is kind of driving me crazy, and I don't even want to be friends w/ someone who can't complete a conversation, and gets distracted and then responds 24 hours later. 
If you don't want to talk me to again (ie you decided there's some reason you don't like me), just say so, instead of just randomly ignoring me.
If you do like me (ie you think I'm special), can we talk briefly about how we can communicate in a way that works for both of us? 
I know you had a rough week, so I don't mean to give you a hard time, but there are basic expectations re: communication that are common courtesy. 
I think you're special and there's a bunch of things I want to do with you! And if you have issues w/ me not knowing what I want, exclusivity, or this just being a rebound, could we talk about it? Sort of ironic b/c I've stopped seeing a bunch of people I was seeing so that I could spend more time w/ you, and now you're totally MIA. 
I want to make plans w/ you and when you totally ignore my request to make plans, it's very difficult for the rest of my schedule, and it makes me feel really unloved. I am one of those people who is used to constant affection, but that's what happens in most mature relationships. 
If you wake up at an odd hour again, feel free to call me at any hour - I'll probably be up! I don't like to leave things hanging and would really love to come to a resolution on this one way or another. 
Or let me know what time we can talk tomorrow.",mixed
"As I'm sitting here, doing work I should have done a month ago now, I realize that I'm a fairly irresponsible, impulsive person. My own impulses and interest in pleasure and validation/love have really trumped my responsibility towards my company. While I feel the weight of this information, I don't feel ridiculously guilty - I am rewiring my mind to not do this again. Much of my unhappiness stems from constantly being in a crisis mode that I created for myself! I am really going to work hard to get myself out of these vicious cycles. I also need an attitude shift - whenever I feel compelled to go have fun or call a boy, etc. I will force myself to get my work done first, or at least a significant milestone. Sometimes I feel so immature. I am feeling better though - I've been working really hard all day and I'm crunching through the projects!",mixed
"2) I'll be really honest, now that I'm no longer distracting myself w/ a zillion dates, I feel lonely. I really just want to be in a normal relationship w/ someone again. Although, I feel like I really need to work through my focus issues, so I can be focused and not so distracted. The right thing for me is to be alone, but I feel the pull of the siren song of being secure and loved in a relationship.",negative
"I'm realizing that all of my stress really comes from work, and the ongoing cycle of freaking out creates tons of disorganization, which creates more freaking out. I just need to break the pattern and do things more in advance, delegate, and prioritize the things that matter.",negative
"I was reading that love addiction stems from neglect as a small child - my parents worked quite hard when I was younger, and then when I was in 2nd grade my mom had a bad fall and went to China for a year to get treated w/ Eastern medicine. That year with my dad as single parent was really rough, and rather lonely, and I was 7 years old at the time I believe. I remember feeling really bipolar - SUPER happy and then SUPER sad. It got better when my mom returned, but I think that year had a big, lasting effect on me. To cope, I invented an imaginary ""boyfriend"" who watched over me; maybe that's where the fantasizing began. In general I don't think my parents spent that much time w/ me, I remember playing Monopoly by myself as a child quite a lot. My sister (8 yrs older) was a grounding force, but once she moved out of the house when I was in 4th grade, I did feel pretty lonely. At the time I was extremely shy so I didn't have many friends or people to talk honestly with.",negative
Unhappy,negative
"Also re the guy I'm seeing not being into me he just took a really long nap in the middle of the day so my instinct that I was having an incorrect automatic thought was correct! He's still a little sporadically responsive at times but he's affectionate by txt, most likely I'll just call him tonight and he'll be available to talk",positive
"So...I talked to A and it turns out that he's a very logical person. He looks at this situation w/ me and thinks that he's a rebound - which he might very well be. I also told him that I'm dating one other person, and he was surprised about that too. So he said that he's going to be cautious and not emotionally invest until I figure out what I really want, which just takes time. I know it's the right thing to do, although frustrating b/c I really like him, and I'm so excited by being around him. He's a good guy, although a little eccentric at times and he's the kind of guy who I could build a solid relationship with. He really does want a relationship and he talks about things like he's more interested in settling down. Anyway, I'm seeing him on Friday - I do like him so much!",positive
"I tried exercising a couple of times but it is so hard to motivate because I find the elliptical really boring. I also talk to friends or sit outside when I need a break. I don't feel very stressed, but my body is reacting really strongly; for example, fatigue, hunger, etc.",negative
"Hi Melody! Yeah, this is finals week for me so I've been pretty busy. Lots of stress-eating too of course...",negative
"Hi Dani! Sorry for being a little aloof lately. For the most part my eating/exercise routines are going well! I'm becoming a lot more aware and comfortable. Unfortunately my older sister who I am very close with has just checked herself into intensive outpatient care for an eating disorder so I guess that's kind of a new factor in my personal journey. Although I worry about her, it's nice to be able to have open and productive dialog about our eating habits since we've both been able to admit to having problems. I am planning to (seriously) do an exposure with tortilla chips (my ultimate vice) later this week with my roommates, whom I have now talked to about hbi and lantern. Obviously eating issues have a renewed importance to me given what my sister is going through, so I will try to get back in the habit of using lantern every day. I hope all is well with you.",mixed
"Hey Dani! Sorry for being kind of aloof lately! I'm traveling with my family right now, which definitely presents different challenges than being at home or at school. When we eat at restaurants it's difficult not to just eat everything on my plate, even though portion sizes are larger than I'm used to. I'm doing okay though! I hope you had a good holiday",mixed
"Hi Dani! Sorry for going AWOL for a bit there!! I went straight from traveling with my family to heading back to school for sorority recruitment which has been consuming virtually all of my time! I still haven't done an exposure.. to be honest the idea of that makes me a little uncomfortable and I haven't really discussed the lantern program with my family or friends much yet. However otherwise I feel like things are mostly going well! Recruitment is a little bit of a tough eating situation because the schedule is chaotic and everyone is eating like they don't know when their next meal will be so it's been a little tough to listen to my body rather than pay attention to what's going on around me. I also have been busy literally every hour of the daylight the past few days so I haven't been able to go running, which I know means I'm a little vulnerable to negative self talk right now. I'm going on a run in a couple hours and hopefully that will make me feel better! This week is my first week of classes so I'm hoping to use that to establish good eating and exercise habits to go along with my new schedule!",mixed
"Hi Dani! So sorry I haven't been in touch - the phone call was an honest mistake! I got called into work and totally forgot. It's going ok for me, I've just been crazy busy with work and final projects for school and going home for the holidays! I need to remember to track my eating because I actually have found myself less likely to binge when I am consistent with my use of Lantern - it makes me more aware of my behaviors! I would love to reschedule our phone call; would Wednesday around 2pm PST work for you at all? I could also do next Friday anytime between noon and 3pm PST",mixed
"Hi Dani! Just finished my LAST FINAL about 10 minutes ago!! Definitely experienced some stress eating over the past week or two, sometimes I was able to talk myself out of it but not always. I'm excited to be headed home tomorrow so I can cook my own yummy healthy food and not worry about school! My goal over break is to figure out a time of day that I consistently log onto lantern so that I can be really serious about improving my relationship with food. I will definitely keep you updated! Thanks for being patient with me!",mixed
Hi Dani! I think I'm adjusting to the site pretty well. As far as a phone call I am free between 4 and 6 pm tomorrow and after 7:30 pm tomorrow and I am free after 4pm on Thursday. I'm also free all morning on Friday! Do any of those times work for you?,positive
Okay great thank you! I think the body image tracking will be really helpful for me,positive
"It was just something I had never really thought about before, so it was an interesting exercise to do! I realized that beauty is definitely not the only (nor the most important) part of the way I view myself",positive
"I think what's most helpful for me is being around and communicating with my family - if I'm not too hungry it helps to say so before our food comes, that way I've kind of established how much I want to eat and I don't lose sight of that once my food arrives.",positive
I don't think I can during those times since I have class. And it was good. I was supposed to eat a burger tonight but those plans got cancelled and. I had indian food which was slightly a negative food for me,mixed
"Also, in your feedback, you mentioned that there is a discussion group; how do I access the group? And while in the past two weeks, I haven't been using laxatives daily, I did I have one day where I abused them a lot and that was a day I wasn't able to check in on here. Luckily, I haven't had as many negative thoughts and guilt associated with eating since I went home for Thanksgiving break, but they're more prevalent when I'm at school. I worry that not having people with me 24/7, like my family, heightens my negative feelings, but it's also tiring to constantly be around friends. How do you suggest I address this? Thanks!",mixed
"I'm not sure about the differences about being at home vs being at school. Thanks for the link to the forum! Also, for today's lesson, the weighing part is difficult. When I first started to lose weight, I would check my weight once a week, maybe twice at most. Then when I got here, it became everyday and then for a little while, maybe 3 weeks, it was at once a hour. Now I've managed to reduce it to at most 5 times a day, but it's still really difficult to get it to that. I'm worried that managing to weigh only once a day is feeling impossible, and I don't know how I can get it to once a week, as the lesson today asked:",negative
"I'm not sure, I've been trying to allow myself a new food about once a week, but it's still difficult, and it hasn't been successful.",negative
"I think you're right about the weighing myself a lot- I didn't realize that until this message, but those small fluctuations in weight have given me ideas about what is ""right"" (exercising and other things) and what is wrong. I just need to focus on breaking this habit of checking my weight so often and get rid of the ideas of right and wrong. I've noticed that seeing an extremely high, in my opinion, number makes me binge as well. But the scale isn't always right. I need to learn that. Also, I do keep track of my food and exercise using myfitnesspal:",negative
Hi! I'm not entirely sure about the phone call as I have two exams this week. And I apologize for not replying; my computer stopped working earlier this week and this is the first time I've gotten to use it!,negative
"So essentially, I feel like if I don't burn a number of calories at the gym everyday, I gain weight, and I know that it's not physically possible to gain weight so quickly with the numbers I'm eating, but it's hard to shake that feeling off. And then if I try to fix it and reduce the amount of time I spend at the gym, I feel worse, so it's hard to make it better",negative
"The past couple of days, I've been eating ""normally"" but it's definitely overeating and even though I haven't checked, I know I've gained weight.",negative
"Hi! Yes, sorry- I've had 3 finals in the past day and a half. I have two more next week and then my schedule should be back to normal.",none

"It was! I didn't particularly pay close attention to my anxiety or stress level before or after doing it, so unfortunately I'm not too sure. However, in my econ class last semester, our GSI had us take 3 deep breaths before our midterms when we had extra time, and for me it didn't seem to ease my worries. But for me to tell myself that things will go all right seemed to work well, as I did that walking to the midterm and didn't feel particularly anxious or nervous for the midterm",mixed

"Hi Melody! My sleep schedule has been a bit off (waking up at 11am or 12pm) so I have a large-ish breakfast/lunch, then head to work and have dinner afterwards, which is the reason (and probably is the reason for all days with 2 meals) for my 2 meals and sometimes snack (often after dinner). And yes, my anxiety levels didn't always decrease because while doing the activity, I actually thought of more things that could happen or more things that I needed to do...hence increasing my stress a bit...I'll try to think things out before starting it so nothing pops up during the activity. Thanks for the feedback! I haven't been sure of how I should respond to it (whether I needed to or...) Have a great night!",mixed
"Hi! Yes, I apologize, it's been a bit overwhelming with me getting on my laptop at about 1 or 2am, but I'm hoping to get back to a normal sleeping and eating schedule this week, so it should be consistent again. There was a bit of issue logging in just now, but it seems to be fine. Happy holidays!",mixed

"Yea, I could try doing it for 2 or 3 days a week. Just the thought if it intimidates me into not even trying. I'm also going to try and eat slower when or if I do start binging. At this point I don't even know what to do to cope without food.",negative
"Hi Ellen! The check in asked how many times in the last 24 hours I binged. For me, when I'm home my whole day or evening is one long binge of constant eating. It's hard to know if that's one binge or more. It's just constant.",negative

Exercise is really important to me because of how unattractive I feel. However I feel so embarrassed about my weight I can't get myself to go to the gym. At the gym I feel as if every person is staring and it makes me feel horrible. But when I can't go exercise I feel disgusting and guilty for not doing it. It's a vicious cycle.,negative

Basically I didn't eat anything until about 2:30 in the afternoon when some friends came over and had cheez-itz with them, so I ate so many of those, like a good 3 or 4 big handfuls. Then like an hour later I got lunch with a friend at the dining hall, which I haven't gone to all semester because it makes me so anxious cause of all the food and I fucked up of course. I had 2 pieces of toast with peanut butter and jelly, granola with soy milk, pasta and fries (like a lot of fries)...and then I went back to my room, tried to do schoolwork, ended up staring at myself in the mirror and pinching and prodding my stomach and thighs and then I went to bed at 7. It was so fucked up and I'm still so upset about it",negative

I got a salad right before 7 so i had that. then we did walks and a group in our building was doing a pie event for thanksgiving break so i had 3 pieces to try them and then i was just so angry at myself cause i didn't even think about it- i just scarfed them down. I know that i'm just gonna feel bad after eating like that so i don't understand why i continue to do that and not stop and think about the effects, i feel like i just wanna act normally and eat the stuff the people around me eat but my reactions don't allow that. and now i'm very anxious for the upcoming week. i'm supposed to weigh myself friday morning. my birthday is friday and my friends are throwing me a party so i can't avoid those scary foods like cake and then it's thanksgiving which is basically sensory overload",negative

I'm so envious of people who don't have any relationship with food- they just eat what and when they want without being concerned. How do those people even exist?",negative

"I'm a graduate student in clinical mental health and have been an addictions counselor for quite a while. So I have some background to draw on. I found some of the questions in the initial survey and then the approach to eating disorders to be very female-oriented. I don't think that men who experience eating disorders, for example, feel shame when they binge or in some other way engage in maladaptive eating behaviors. I became immediately stuck in the first lesson because it didn't seem to relate to me to reflect my challenges with off and on binge eating. This was particularly true with all the body image emphasis. I found that to be way off track for me. I understand how that is a common challenge for women with eatings disorders, but I'm not so sure that it is as common among men. So I'm not sure that the program will be helpful for me. What do you think?",negative
"The other thing that I noticed both in the survey and in the approach is that it seems quite oriented to traditional college students and not for older nontraditional students. I think that the eating concerns for older adults may be different in nature. The context may change from concerns about body image and comparing yourself to others to simply wanting to be healthy, particularly for older adults who struggler with obesity.",negative

"Today since I was hungry, I let myself eat more than usual, and although it was a bit uncomfortable afterwards to think that I ate more than usual and also did not exercise, it wasn't devastating and I tried not to dwell on it, so I hope that allowing myself to not worry too much will help me be more flexible overall..",positive
"I guess part of it is fear to eat whatever I want because in the past often it would lead to binging and weight gain, but I'm hoping that I can slowly work up to not having to count calories/eating other foods after I regulate my hunger I guess?",positive

I think coming to terms with my body would mean reaching a point where if you ask we if I want my physical appearance to be any different from what I see in the mirror my answer would be no. I have very limited experience with this feeling, almost to the extent that it sounds foreign, but I think that once I reach that state I will be a much happier person. Coming to terms with food would mean not having it be part of what determines my mood or how well my day is going or how satisfied/dissatisfied I am with my control around food. This idea is even more alien to me than the concept of being happy with my body but I recognize that in order to maintain a weight that I am happy with my issues with food need to be resolved",negative
I think you're right. I have been trying to eat more regularly and I have noticed that I am skipping more meals because I don't feel hungry. I've been trying to eat regularly though.,mixed
"On the whole I was starting to do better. When I started up school again I started eating less. For instance yesterday I only had one meal and today I had one meal and a snack.

I have been feeling stressed... I am no longer seeing my therapist on campus and am trying to figure it out in my own. I've been trying to meditate but can't seem to find time.,negative
I am fine thanks for checking. Sorry it has been a while things have been chaotic in my life recently.,negative
I just did the meal planner. I usually dont have time to eat meals in between classes and work. Are there any kind of quick meals that will keep me full and let me eat quick and go? I know eating fast leads to overeating but I have to unfortunately.,negative

diet pill and it's only sporadic when I take them. I am not comfortable with talking over the phone also because I really don't have enough spare time for anything right now. Unfortunately being overwhelmed and busy is my motivation right now.",negative

I don't feel like i have many interests or things that I absolutely have or want to do. Its awfully depressing sometimes.",negative
"Unfortunately it depends on the day. For instance Tuesdays and Wednesdays it is breakfast. On those days I eat a granola bar. On Tuesdays and Thursdays I have to squeeze in lunch. I usually eat like a frozen burrito or a sandwich if I eat at all. On Mondays, Tuesdays (these are my worst days for meals), Wednesdays, and Thursdays its dinner. For those I usually do some sort of soup or a frozen meal. I have done salads but I dont feel that they keep me full. At the same time the frozen quick meals arent all that healthy and they dont keep me full as long either. The granola bars work but eating a granola bar for breakfast and lunch everyday gets old very quick.",negative
Also what's the deal with sugar and weight? I watched this documentary and I am not sure if it's a real thing or not.,none
They were making a claim that sugar causes you to store fat quicker and you should watch sugar instead of just counting calories,none
"Thanks for the feedback! I have noticed that I don't binge as much either and I think that's because I'm genuinely happier. I think I tend to binge when I'm stressed or feeling particularly down and I haven't had those feelings very much lately so that helped! Although exams are coming up and I know I'm going to be very stressed out so that will be tough. But I like the grounding techniques and the counting ones a lot so I'll be sure to use them during exam week and hopefully they'll help! The thing about pasta and meat is that I don't consider them forbidden, I love both of those things a lot. Chicken and steak and probably my favorite things to eat! But those are the two types of food that give me the most anxiety when eating and fear of immediate weight gain after eating them, which makes it difficult for me to enjoy them when I do eat them. Honestly I can't remember when that started but for as long as I can remember I've always ordered vegetarian things or not eaten the meat in certain things and I have no idea why! So I guess it just stuck and when I started to get paranoid about my body I guess I figured that if I started eating it now it would make me gain weight. But it helps when I remind myself that I actually do love meat and pasta and they are both okay to eat especially since I don't that often. That usually reduces my anxiety and makes me feel better when eating them.",mixed
"Hey Dawn! I don't think I am interested in talking on the phone. I'm sorry. But I don't mind at all chatting here! In response to your email, I think I have noticed subtle changes. Nothing major, but changes none the less! Like today I packed myself a snack for school while I was away from my house. Normally I would have just waited until I got home to eat. And I know that the snack is better because then I won't be starving when I get home and end up binging. I was very proud of myself for that. I do not like the meal planner technique very much. I don't really like to plan out exactly what to eat every day. Sometimes I'll do that in my head but i know I could deviate from that a little bit and it's okay. If I write it down like that I think it would take it too literally and I don't like the thought of that. I really like the counting techniques! They are very very helpful to me. The weigh in does scare me a little because I have to admit that I'm scared of seeing the number go up. I normally never weigh myself because I always thought it was bad so starting to do it now is scary. But, I'm willing to try!",mixed
"It's worked out pretty nicely actually! I've assigned 2 days as rest days and it turns out that's extremely helpful for me since I have a very busy semester. I'm having a hard time with binging again though late at night. It's never as bad as it used to be or as often, but I've been noticing it again. I think it might have to do with wanting a distraction honestly. It gives me a break from doing homework. Since I'm more aware of it and the reasons why it's happening I think I have a better idea of how to stop it though",mixed
"Just got your email! I think the hardest thing for me to do is eat lunch. I think that if I have extra snacks around that time then I won't need an actual meal. I guess that started because first semester freshmen year of college I gained a lot of weight pretty quickly and, although there were many reasons why that happened, one of the things I was doing was eating 3 meals a day. So I guess I clung to the thought that I really didn't need lunch and that would cause me to lose weight. I don't really know if that worked or whatever but I've stuck to that for a while and it's a hard habit to shake. I've been trying though but I think it might take some time before it really gets better. My body image is really affected by comparing myself to others and how I used to look my senior year of highschool. I have noticed that I'm not scanning my old Facebook photos as much anymore which is really nice. However I live with 8 girls and everyone is very obsessed with looks and the gym and things like that. Two girls in particular are especially skinny and really pretty and people really like them and it's hard not to compare myself to them. I've been more active about trying not to let it get to me but it's not easy when they're constantly around me. I haven't been able to use the discussion board because honestly it's a little confusing. I've been waiting for a time when I'm not so busy so I can really figure it out.",negative
I really don't knkw what the difference is between looking in the mirror and then at pictures. I've been trying to figure it out for a while and I truly don't understand. It's really frustrating. I'll have to try out your ideas and see if that helps.,negative
"I've just been more aware of what I'm doing and making conscious efforts to not binge. I also think my daily eating habits have become better so that helps reduce the urge to binge. I hit roadblocks when there is a lot of food available for free and easy to get. Then I seem to eat regardless of if I'm hungry or not simply by convince. The negative thought that seems to pop up the most is that I've eaten too much when most of the time I know I haven't. But feeling myself full and my stomach expand a little from being full, my thought goes to it being too much and gaining weight even though that isn't reAlly logical. It's been hard putting my replacement into action recently because work really messes with my food schedule. It's hard to plan meals when I'm so bored I end up just eating anything to pass the time! But I am excited to go back to axhool and practice this and all the other things I'm learning!",positive
"Being home is such a blessing. I'm so much happier here. Keeping routines is much easier here since j don't have any excuses. Since I'm happier to begin with, I have more of a desire to keep myself that way and do things that make me feel good.",positive
"Being home has been so so so wonderful. I already feel much better about myself. I don't have many plans for the summer but I am working so that gives me something to do. I am excited to start running again and start eating better. I am unhappy with my body right now, but being home has put me in a better mood already and that helps me want to better myself. I'm looking forward to the rest of the summer and seeing where things go.",positive
"I definitely think being at home will make things easier. I know it's the holidays and I won't be able to really work out since I don't have a gym at home, but being around my family and friends makes me so happy. That makes it easier to deal with everything. and I won't have the stress of my roommates or school to distract me.",positive
"Hey dawn! I am happy to say that my motivation for exercise has gone back up! A friend and I joined a spinning group and we take that class a few times week. And I started a new job, which has made eating healthy easier again. I really really hated my old job. It made me such an angry person and that just resulted in bad food choices and laziness. Thankfully I was able to get out of that situation and I am so happy about it.",positive
"What does the question mean when it says ""flexible with your eating""?",none
Absolutely! I do tend to have a snack after dinner because I am up so late. I am currently eating more on my family's schedule than mine because they're all here for Thanksgiving. I will definitely try to shift them though in order to get three meals in.,positive
"I know it's been helpful for me to be eating just two regular meals a day. I'll probably be able to get to three after thanksgiving break when I'm back school, but right now I'm sleeping in enough that when I get hungry after waking up, it's usually about lunch time.",positive
"Yes, that does help! No, I don't really struggle with flexibility with eating",positive
"I already eat pretty healthy foods actually, so eating better for me would be portion control. A healthy food isn't so healthy anymore once I've eating 10 too many servings of it...",negative
"I started going to a therapist from school about a month ago. And I went to a nutritionist two days ago. Talking to the therapist feels kind of liberating, like I can talk about something my family would think is stupid without feeling judged. But I liked the nutritionist better. I guess I just like facts better. And she did all these calculations to see what I should be eating and how many calories I should be eating. And I'm still reluctant to follow the plan, but I understand why she's right.",mixed

"Hi dani, 
I know that maybe people haven't noticed that I've gained weighty, but I can feel it. And I hate that feeling. And I feel powerless. I feel like I have no real control over my life, so I've been avoiding logging in on purpose because I'm scared that I'm gaining weight because I stopped purging. Thinking about the self esteem exercise does make me feel better. I think about how I said I liked my intelligence. But then that goes away when I look at myself in the mirror. It's such a weird feeling. I guess yesterday was the best day. I tried to focus only on important things. Internship applications, packing for a trip, talking to friends. But what ended happening is that I ate almost nothing. I don't know if it's because of my Crohn's disease (I've been feeling terribly dizzy so I don't get hungry) or if that dizziness is caused by how fat I feel. What do you think? I guess those are the barriers getting in the way.",mixed
Hi Anna! Thank you for all the reminders. I've been in Switzerland for 4 days and life has been insane. I'll try to get back into a Go Lantern schedule!,negative
Hi Anna! I would definitely be interested in it. I've in Geneva for a bit over a week. The first few days I absolutely forgot about my (bad) eating behaviors but for the past 3 days I've been going crazy and purging.

"Hey Dani!
Last week was not so good. I had the winter formal and i wanted to fit into a dress that is my usual size. But because of thanksgiving I was scared it wouldn't fit me, so I barely ate for 3 days. I've gone back to eating normally though, and I'm trying to stick to the 1,500 calories the nutritionist wants me to eat.",negative
"Hi Dani! I guess healthy to me depends only on my weight. Healthy is being skinny, and the process of getting there is pretty much unimportant. I usually eat very little, try to eat mostly liquids (somehow they feel less fattening). I know it sounds stupid. But that's healthy for me.",negative
"Hi Dani,
Yesterday and today have been good. My nutritionist gave me an eating plan and although I can't completely stick to it, it kind of gives me directions of how to eat. I still need to add more protein to my diet, I feel like I mostly just eat yogurt. I've also tried to weigh myself less. I weighed myself today for the first time since Tuesday and freaked out. Stupid thanksgiving. But I then called my partner and he distracted me so I forgot about it. I'm enjoying the daily 15 minutes, they're fun. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow AM. Have a good week!",positive
"As for the breaking the chain exercise, I liked the technique for today. 4-7-8 breathing. Talking to my therapist, she made me realize that the most difficult thing for me is my reaction to things I don't like. So if I see a number on the scale I don't like I'll purge, etc. Breathing and just sitting down and relaxing usually helps things.",positive
"I just finished week 9 of treatment, and I finished the semester at school last week! I can't begin to describe how difficult treatment has been for me... It has brought up so much, an d I have put in so much energy. Honestly, it really negatively impacted school, but I just got final grades, and I ended up with a 3.908 GPA for the semester, which is pretty awesome considering how unbelievably draining treatment has been. Most days, it's a struggle to do anything. Even move. I missed 3/4 of my classes over the past 2 months",mixed
"Thanks so much for your encouragement and support! It means a lot. Other ways I might be able to connect with myself are through mindful meditation, drawing, and journaling. I actually journaled (in a more creative style rather than traditional journaling) last night. It was helpful in that it helped me check in with how I was doing. The other effect it had was to make me cry...",mixed

What's more is that I have felt SO MANY feelings that ED didn't allow me to feel. and the PTSD... ugh. So bad. It feels so dark a lot of the time, but also, sometimes, I see some hope (like right now). I still have soooo much work to do, but here are two of the best parts: 1. I can cry again. Like all of the time. Which is so fucking good. I can't believe I'm saying it, but it's so refreshing to be able to cry.",mixed

This is my 25th day straight of following my meal plan 100% and using no behaviors (other than body checking, weighing, caffeine use, and diet drinks) but no binging, purging, or restricting. Take that ED! It's sooo hard, Most meals are a battle... and I'm winning. Fuck. ED.

Sorry this is so long. I needed to share.",positive
I also felt like I was slightly disadvantaged as I do not have an iphone and therefore could not access the app. Having an app would have made it more easily accessible. As for future plans I have a small break from uni at the moment (2 weeeks off) so I would like to implement some healthy coping strategies during this time so that when things get hectic again I will be comfortable using them.,mixed
Unfortunately due to having a very stressful year thus far I have not made any progress but I feel that I do have the tools to help me now and am feeling more motivated at the moment to elicit this change. The program was actually quite good and unfortunately I don?t have any constructive feedback to help improve it. Maybe more scheduled check ins and a better meal planner system to keep track of progress. I know that it shouldn?t be a major focus of the program as it is trying to eliminate these habits but overall I find it would have been helpful for myself,mixed
I think my biggest issue with coping mechanisms is that I often forget about them in the moment and instead adopt my unhealthy coping mechanisms which I have been using for so long. Making healthy strategies a habit rather than something I have to actively think about would make it a lot easier during those times. I hope I have adequately answered all your questions. I would love to have organised a phone call at some stage but I have friends and family visiting over the next week.,mixed
This year has been a little bit of a crazy year. Unfortunately the weight hasn't come due to better eating habits. I went through a particularly hard time and was bingeing a lot without the purge to compensate as I just didn't have the energy or motivation. As a result I put on a lot of weight. At the moment however I am incredibly motivated to maintain a healthier weight and regain my control after meeting an amazing guy and actually getting excited about my future again.,mixed
Thank you for all your check-ins I am sorry that I was so absent throughout it all. My motivation disappeared and was incredibly hard to find again.,negative
"Placement has been pretty intense. Long days. But the routine and everything has been beneficial, except today when I forgot to take morning tea! I was more than a little devastated since it was a 7am start. but besides that eating has been fine. Had a minor sugar ""binge"" the other day after a long day of placement. 
I still have negative thoughts about my body but I guess since I have been busy I have been distracted from that too.",negative
When I first developed my eating disorder I had anorexic tendencies which then moved on to bulimia (both vomiting and exercising as my purge) over the past year I have put on a considerable amount of weight and with that my period has returned and is regular.,negative
Hey! My week has been a bit up and down. Yesterday was a struggle but I'm not quite sure what the trigger was. I ended up bingeing and then using exercise as my purge. Maybe it was boredom? I'm also getting anxious about Christmas.,negative
Hey I am so sorry about my complete non-compliance with the program. I was very motivated at the beginning but life kind of got in the way and I completely lost my way. I am so happy that I still had access to all the tools today as I went through each of the techniques and found ones that I think will be helpful for me in the future. One I found would be particularly helpful was the opposite action one. It is a great way to recognise negative behaviours and thoughts and equips me with the appropriate action to take to avoid negative behaviour.,positive

"Thanks Melody, my week has been a bit stressful. I've gotten some sleep, but less since I have finals this week. I also haven't been able to go to the gym at all this week, and that makes me want to eat less to restrict my calories.",negative
"I thought it was fun but I actually found myself thinking much more about negatives than positives, which I don't think was the most helpful. But maybe it will be more helpful in the future, we'll see!",mixed
"That would definitely be difficult to me since i tend to eat little and often (I get full quickly but then hungry more between meals), but I could try it. I am home for break and the rest of my family is on a 3-meal schedule, so this could be a good time to try getting back into that.",mixed
"I think for food reintroduction it was easiest to do it with my roommate and just explain what I was doing. It definitely helped me feel accountable while still supported. I think I had more binge eating episodes this unit because this has been a pretty busy and stressful month. I usually end up binge eating when I'm upset or when I'm stressed. On the up side, the episodes did not put me into a downward spiral or anything like that. I just sort of said ok that happened today and tomorrow is a new blank slate. I do that a lot when I am disappointed in myself because or else I'll hold onto something from a month before that I can't do anything about now.",mixed
"Hi Ellen! Yeah it's definitely been outside commitments that have been getting in the way. I'm in shopping period for classes, so my schedule is moving around a lot. I also quit my part-time job and started another, so that has made my schedule a bit wacky. And then on top of that, I'm starting a research position that I'm in the process of scheduling. I usually take 12-14 credits per semester, and this semester I'm taking 17 so things are pretty crazy. I'm hoping I can nail down more of a routine though. Right now I'm not getting enough sleep so I have been sleeping late some days and messing up my schedule. Any advice on getting my sleep schedule under control? I feel like if I get that right, I can manage my commitments more and then carve out more before-bed time for the program. My issue is always so silly, but I literally just don't go to bed. Like I see what time it is, I badger myself about how I need to go to bed NOW, but I don't always do it. Sometimes I have too much energy still, but sometimes I just get lazy or something. Anyway, if you have any advice on regulating my routine in general, let me know!",negative
"Regarding work, this semester I got out of class at 2:30, stopped home briefly to pack some food, and then left the house at 3. Then I am off work any time between 6:30 and 9, so if it's a 6:30 night then i could eat at 7 when I get home, but if it's a 9 then I'm going to need food during and after. Also some nights I work and then have night class after at 8, so in those cases I just sort of grab food whenever I have a spare minute. It's not ideal, but hopefully my schedule can work better next semester.",negative
"Hi! Regular eating went pretty well over break because my family is on that schedule, but it has been difficult since I got back to school because my schedule fluctuates more. For example, on days when I work I tend to have two smaller dinners because I can't make it through work on only a snack, but I also can't pack a whole dinner. Not sure what to do about that but I'm trying to come up with ideas. Weighing myself is definitely tough for me. I tend to go through phases for a few months of weighing myself every day and then avoiding weighing myself for a while. Usually when I know I am not in a healthy weight range I avoid weighing, and then when I get more motivated to get healthier I start weighing again until that sort of wears off. I know I am at an unhealthy weight for myself so this session was the first time I weighed myself in a few months. It definitely was not enjoyable.",negative
"I have a question about the meal planning. I tend to get really hungry at night, not very late but maybe like 9 oclock if i have dinner at 7. And then I get up pretty late for class so if I went with this meal plan I would have no food between 7pm and 11am or 12pm the next day, which is a long time for me. Not sure if it's ok to add in a snack at around 9am instead of one of the midday ones? Sometimes I just have dinner later anyway, but I know leaving it up in the air is not good for keeping my metabolism regular. Anyway, let me know what you think.",none
Ok thanks! yeah things have been very busy but I'm going to try to get back going on the program,positive
"As far as the holiday season, it has been going surprisingly well! It helps that I am gluten free, so I can't really splurge on holiday deserts. Also, I am much more active and less stressed when I am home with my family, so I have been able to focus on getting back into exercising. I used to love running but hadn't done it for years, and so I've started to work on getting back into that! I've actually had a record low of binging situations this past month--I don't think I binged at all! I have actually been much better since I have started the program as well, so I wan't to get back to it as the new semester approaches (aka more stress). Hopefully things continue to go well!",positive

"Hello Caroline. Thank you for staying in contact. I want to let you know that I have been hospitalized for bradycardia. low heart rate, which the doctors agree is related to undernourishment. Rest assured, I'm being well cared for at the Comprehensive Care Program at El Camino Hospital. The appropriate individuals on Stanford campus have been notified about my condition, and will be helping to facilitate accommodations. I will be putting in place a follow-up plan with the staff here to help me recover and maintain stability once I am ready for discharge. I hope to emerge from this experience restored and motivated to strike a better balance and improve my lifestyle and functionality. Thank you for your reflections and for continuing to work with me.",mixed
"Hello Caroline. Sorry for missing the call today. Are you still able to talk tomorrow at 11am? Should I be the one to contact you? Generally, I've found the program very helpful so far and I really appreciate your feedback. You've shared some really valuable observations and insights with me and guided me toward behaviors which might target triggers for chaotic eating and poor body image and self esteem. I find the grounding tools helpful for making me more mindful and aware of my current state of being, emotions, thoughts, and sensations. I continue to struggle with intrusive thoughts about food when trying to do any sort of activity, and find it especially difficult to be in control of my behaviors when I'm not engaged in a specific task. Transitioning from one stage of the day to the next is very challenging. In particular, the first hour or so after a meal poses a big challenge for me and I find myself thinking about how full I feel and how long it will be before I get to eat next. I'm really through with my family having to deal with my behaviors and having so much negative attention focused on me. I'm grateful that there are people who care for me, but I really wish I could just handle personal problems on my own. I really want to return back to a place where I can be steady and utilize all aspects of myself. Right now, I find myself being drained of energy, both physical and mental, much of the time. I also experience boredom when I think I shouldn't, and time often seems to drag by at a glacial pace. I'm really grateful to be with family right now and in the comfort of home. I need to work on being OK when I'm not burning calories and feeling like my stomach is empty and feeling strong and stretched. I look forward to our conversation. Again, apologies for missing the call today.",mixed
"Thank you for the update you sent me yesterday. I have been unable to access the exercise tracker, the weight monitor, and the body image tracker through the techniques app even though I am receiving messages via email reminding me to use them. I hope this is not a glitch in the system. I look forward to discussing further tomorrow. Something I would like to discuss is the fact that over the next several weeks, I may not have consistent internet access, and therefore, I may not be able to engage with the program as regularly for a while. I hope this does not interfere with anything. Thanks.",negative
"Hello Caroline, Running is my primary form of exercise. I run anywhere from as 25-70 miles per week, and have done so for the past couple years. Running serves as a way to wipe the slate clean so to speak, to burn calories, to be outdoors, to de-stress, to be away from people, to do something physical, to challenge myself not just mentally, etc.. Running serves many purposes for me. I also bike aggressively, use the elliptical machine, row, and do some weight lifting, pull-ups, push-ups, etc. Cardio is definitely my primary form of exercise thought. I experience intense anxiety and irritation when I do not get cardio in even when I plan to take a day off. I have difficulty transitioning after eating to whatever I'm doing next and dealing with intrusive thoughts about food. I often times find myself thinking about food either in the back of my mind or in the front of my mind for much of the day. I also have difficulty distracting myself and re-focusing on something else when caught in these patterned thoughts. I am working on disciplining my mind and learning how to make my behaviors more intentional. I notice that when I feel that my eating is out of control, my irritation and anxiety become even more potent. Please let me know if you have advice as to how I can deal with these thoughts and behaviors in a healthy way to keep things in balance.",negative
"Hello Caroline,
Thank you for your message. I am currently on vacation with my family and have tried to be more tuned into my emotional states and behaviors. I've noticed that when I'm particularly distressed by body image and body sensations, I become irritated with those around me and my thoughts gravitate toward isolation and discontent. Yesterday my father remarked at one point that he felt as though I was hostile and angry toward him because I kept expressing that I felt as though he was singling me out and was acting paranoid. I believe that my weight is stable and maybe mildly fluctuating up and down, mainly down a few pounds. I still feel powerful feelings of guilt when I eat and think about the work that I will have to do to make up for the caloric intake in the future. I am not restricting my food intake persay, but I am still attempting to be cautious about the type of food I eat and to some extent the quantity of food I consume. I feel quite uncomfortable when I do not get a high amount of physical activity in, and I feel as though I enjoy feeling lean. I'm not sure which of these feelings about body image are wrong, but when I do things that I feel will make me depart from being ""lean enough"" so-to-speak, I experience a high degree of distress and irritability. I become particularly irritated when I am putting calories in my body that I'm uncertain as to what they will do to me -- extra calories outside of three balanced meals - and when I do not know when I will be able to regulate what those calories will do to me through physical activity and periods of not eating. I have been weighing myself fairly frequently, and notice that I become a little freaked out and depressed when the scale reads a weight higher than anticipated, which for me is anything above 130 pounds at 5'7''. I am working on shifting my mindset toward the number on the scale, but have difficultly controlling how the number makes me feel. I feel as though weight gain is associated with failure and laziness in my mind, and that is why I am experiencing so much distress around eating behavior, weight, body image, etc. Thanks again for your feedback.",negative
"Hi Caroline. I would just like to give you some more background on my situation. I have been struggling with an eating disorder and compulsive ""driven"" exercise for years. I have struggled with binging and purging (through exercise and restriction). I have intrusive thoughts about food which interfere with my ability to concentrate and thrive in other areas of life. I struggle with body image issues, self-confidence, and self-worth, and exercise is a partial personal treatment for these mental frameworks. I have been seeing a psychologist and nutritionist for several years now and I have yet to make significant improvements in improving thought patterns. I have been a runner for several years, and running is my exercise of choice. I do not usually feel like I've exercised enough to feel OK about myself for the day unless I've fit in five to ten miles of running and some push-ups and pull-ups. I also bike and use the elliptical machine when my joints and muscles ache, though I feel that I must do much more of these activities in terms of time than I would devote to running in order to get in an equivalent workout. I have a difficult time taking break days, and feel that I must get in this minimum amount of activity to maintain current weight and muscle mass (even though I am unable to recognize or understand exactly how I look to others; I only know my own standard of how I ought to look). Eating often feels out of control and overwhelming to me, and I feel incredibly self-conscious about eating and how it affects the way I look and feel. I often feel bloated and fat after eating. I very rarely feel satisfied and ready to transition to another activity after meals. After dinnertime in particular, controlling eating becomes a real challenge for me, and this is when I tend to binge on usually cereal, power bars, and sometimes sweets. I've been told that these binges are likely the result of my body trying to make up for caloric deficits very quickly, though they feel very uncomfortable. I should emphasize that I feel very bloated and round around the middle much of the time and feel that this is unfair considering how much work I put into staying trim. I would love your suggestions as to how I can balance healthy eating and exercise. My goal is to be athletic and to feel good about the way I look and feel and to not feel distress when eating.",negative
"You have correctly identified a scenario in which I feel loss of control -- after eating something I view as unhealthy or portions that are unhealthy and will make me gain weight, I feel very much caught in a cycle that forces me to only think about the instantaneous gratification from doing something that contradicts behaviors that I engage in at other times. Eating carbohydrates and sugars often causes me distress as I feel as though they are the triggers for chaotic eating behavior. When I eat protein, light dairy products, fruits and veggies, I feel more comfortable.",negative
"Hi Caroline. I hope you also had an enjoyable Thanksgiving. Thank you for your feedback. I have found the program helpful so far.

"The only problem with my grocery shop choice is that I can seem to make myself eat the carrots and salad. In regards to inncidents that can ""snap"" me out of binging, I have no idea. I know lots of people try/say to go workout when you want to eat, but that doesn't work for me. Or they say to do some sort of activity that distracts you. However, it is very difficult for me to find things to distract me from wanting to eat. Binging to me is literally an adiction, where it's always in the back of my mind at night, no matter what I do, whether its reading, watching tv, homework, cleaning, writing, etc. The plate inncident was different because it was something that had to be cleaned up NOW because otherwise it would harm people living in my apartment, and I was really worried if whether or not I got rid of all the pieces on the floor. Additionally, this week, I made a mini goal to concentrate on eatting better, and didn't excersize. I didn't count calories as much and ate better foods for me and limited my portions and tried not to binge. I binged only three days. The first was because I couldn't sleep due to social anxiety, the second was because my friend took me out to a mexican restaurant and I was starving and I couldn't say no to the chips, and the thrid was becaue I attended an awful work party. Next week, my mini goal (in addition to still eatting healthier) is to do cardio 5 out of 7 days.",mixed

I'm a bit uncomfortable talking over the phone. How about I explain why I'm interested in Lantern and my goals from using it?
In the past year, both my father and brother have been diagnosed with either diabetes or borderline diabetes. I also know my grandfathers on both sides of my family had diabetes. It?s only a matter of time before I get it. And right now, I eat way too much sugar.
I also emotionally eat by binging. When I?m stressed or sad, I eat to get the dopamine to feel better. I?ve done this for probably six years now, but it?s gotten much worse due to various factors such as loss of a social circle and pressure to find a job after I graduate. 
When I entered college I weighed 145 pounds. Now I weigh 160. I?ve gone through bursts to try to loose the weight, but I always end up gaining it back. 
Essentially, I?d like to develop better eating habits so that I

"I ended up not having the time to get to the grocery store this weekend, but definitely can today. I'm still weighing my options because making bigger batches is more time-efficient, but making smaller batches is more cost-efficient because I don't run as high of a risk with spoiling food.

"I actually think its more a product of the places where I work with food? Most of the programs I work and study with are really focused on local, sustainable food, building better relationships with the people who bring food to the public.

I was going out for Thai a lot over the past few months, and it turned out that my favorite veggie-rice dish had fish and oyster sauce. I never thought to ask before, since it's not nomally something in vegetable dishes, but the fact that it was non-vegetarian without my knowing explains the stomach aches I was getting.",none

I seem to be on a pattern of eating 4 smaller meals a day, since that's how my schedule works out. I almost always go to the local deli during my lunch break to get a berry-almond milk smoothie (or sometimes a banana-date smoothie), which I'm happy with.

This week is ok. Less binging and purging, more restricting and stimulant use. A lot of stress with grocery shopping, driving into the grocery store parking lot, sitting for 10 minutes to contemplate if i really want to go in...and then leaving. So food obsession is still really consuming my day. Quite exhausting. School begins on Monday. A bit nervous to see if that hurts or helps the eating",mixed

I'm afraid that I will never get over my binge eating and I will continue to struggle with this for the rest of my life. Thoughts like these make me feel as if there is no point in trying. I don't want to give up, which is why I'm coming back, if that's okay.",mixed
"Do you have suggestions on anything I can do to not binge eat? I After completing my session last night, I binge ate. I feel disappointed in myself but I don't want to fall into the cycle of binging again. What can I do?",negative
"I am feeling behind on my studies and have other work and things on my plate. Sometimes I feel overwhelmed and discouraged to study. During those times, I tend to eat while studying, which eventually lead to binge eating. I would eat food that I don't normally eat (chips and/or ice cream). In one sitting, I can eat the entire party size bag of chips and/or a tub of ice cream. I usually don't feel very well afterward but I also feel very disappointed in myself. I tend to repeat this behavior for several days before I finally snap out of it and get back to my regular eating.",negative
"The last couple months have been challenging. I started clinical rotations and have not really had control of when I can eat and my sleep have been affected as well. All of that combined with being in a new environment, stress, and fear have contributed.",negative
"Hi Melody, thanks for checking in. I am finally beginning to feel like I have control again. I have been able to identify some of the triggers for the past binge eating with the help of the counselor I mentioned in our phone chat. I have also been trying to be more mindful of my emotions, moods, and reactions. The mindfulness techniques included here are helpful. I have also met with my yoga instructor to talk about additional techniques (e.g. deep breathing, using a mantra) to help handle stress. I have met with a nutritionist to determine if my binge eating were triggered by physiological needs. I have been working towards acceptance of situations that I have no control of and to be more forgiving of my self. Lastly, I have made an intention to go 21 days without binge eating as an attempt to break this habit. I am at day 15 at the moment and still going strong. I hope you had a wonderful weekend.",positive
I will work to incorporate some of the deep breathing and meditation into the moments when I am feeling stress or considering binge eating.,positive
"Identifying my stressors has been the most important part. The mindfulness and relaxation activities have been most helpful to get me through tough days. I've gotten better about recognizing when I am stressed/anxious. During those instances, I take a break from whatever I'm doing to try do some deep breathing and think positive thoughts. I've been working on doing that when I'm not particularly stressed so these activities are easier to pick up during my tough times.",positive
"I usually like the feeling afterward. I feel more relaxed, focused, and happy.",positive
I decided to stop doing the cleansing diet because I wanted to try out having a set time of day and knowing what I will be eating a chance. I have never had anything like it so I think it is a great way of me not only losing weight but also eating healthy. And I realized that I was doing this program to better myself so I would rather invest in it fully by stopping the cleansing diet.,positive
"Hi Michelle, I am so excited to see what I can benefit from this program. I want to thank you in advance for all your support!",positive
"How much more do I have left of Phase 1? I liked the emotion tracking, it forced me to be somewhat self-aware. I went home this past weekend and almost made it the whole time without bingeing but I overate around 11PM on my last night there- about four cookies and two bags of M&Ms (and a lot of banana bread) which isn't that bad, but I'd been giving up chocolate for Lent and sort of lost control over that. I've identified that ""open kitchen"" situations are much more difficult for me than the dining halls, so that's why I binge more at home than at school. I am tracking my eating a little more carefully in anticipation of spring break next week.",mixed
"Thanks, I will definitely check out the discussion board. Just to clarify--I threw up today but it wasn't a binge or even overeating, I just felt really sick to my stomach this morning for some reason. All good now!",mixed
"Honestly, a little bit of both. It's been such a long time since I've eaten pasta or bread except very rarely, we're talking year, because I didn't want to be fat. I never even write them down as avoiding food because they hardly tempt me at this point. Despite my lack of a plan I have incorporated one into my diet and have made improvements regarding my attitude about it: earlier this week, I had a bout of what Vaden believed to be viral gastroenteritis, which is sort of a 24-hour stomach bug that goes away on its own. So I had nausea/vomiting/diarrhea for a day (I know, it was horrible, and I was also on my period at the same time haha) but then to recover they suggest very bland foods so I ate both a donut and mashed potatoes the next day, which was quite unusual and sort of liberating. Then today my roommate asked me if I wanted her to save me a bagel and I said yes, AND I had lemon poppyseed bread at breakfast. I vaguely wonder if I will gain weight if I continue to eat bread, but it's not like I have my ideal body without eating bread for years, so.",mixed
"And sorry if I've missed some days, I've been really busy",negative
"Thanks for the feedback, sorry I'm just getting back to you now. I haven't weighed myself yet (I don't have a scale in my dorm room, so I have to remember to do it when I'm at the gym), but I'll let you know how that goes. Plus that setup works well with weighing myself regularly without being obsessive about it. I've felt good and I'm doing well. I'm definitely more of a sticking to routines person, so I've tried to keep what I'm eating and when pretty consistent as well as getting to sleep early and making time for my ""self-care"" activities. I have a strong aversion to reaching out to friends or family; it's easier for me to talk to a stranger, but I feel like I'm equipped with the resources to do that if I need to (which I haven't recently). I also went to a stress workshop yesterday, since the nutritionist identified that as a subconscious trigger, and saw some mobile apps for practicing yoga, deep breathing, mindfulness, etc. (Similar to the exercise Lantern has).",positive
"I don't find the dining hall a problem; on the contrary, I am often best able to limit my meals to one plate there. It's when I'm snacking in my room that I tend to binge more often (e.g. eating multiple full-size chocolate bars at once, not being able to stop once I've started) but I've been good so far about that at least for the past week. I still have my appointment on Thurs. so I'll let you know how that goes",positive
"Oh, I do think that I've made progress in general, I just meant progress in terms of literally completing the activities, because I'm only halfway done with the first part of three. I haven't truly binged or purged in a long time, which is awesome",positive
"No, I didn't. But I did read about the media's role in self-image which was interesting.",positive
"I did! I have also had a sandwich for the past couple days which is very strange. I think I will try to keep weighing myself regularly which I haven't been doing, and then assuming that I don't see the number change a lot I won't feel guilty about eating those foods",positive
"So I ended up not doing that, but I did eat rice with my friend which I normally don't",positive
"Hi Jacqui, yeah when you don't hear from me its rather safe to assume things are not so great at least regarding the focus of lantern program.
I've been working a lot, not getting physical activities, being stressed out and just haven't been having a balanced routine that I would like to have. Last week was better since I decided to make some changes. Thank for letting me know about this, enjoy your trip! :)
I've been doing better, and I'm sure things are going to get better. I'm just in rather a crunch time and ambiguously at this moment.",mixed
"Hi Jacqui, I don't think I'm ready for that. I feel I should be able to do this on my own. But thanks for the info, I might use it at some point in the future. Thanks",mixed
"Hi Jacqui, thanks for checking up on me. By taking it easy I meant to not push myself so much for exercising everyday and allow eating treats I normally won't. I just finished finals this week and start my work on Monday (which frankly I'm nervous about as well). I have lost my routine but the goal is to get back to a routine I can maintain as soon as I can.",mixed
"Hi Jacqui, I did listen to it and it was great timing!! I had a stressful day today and I started off trying to sing aloud with the song in my car (which helped) but soon in the day I forgot about being playful and went back to my stressed out mode! So I know I should practice this more.",mixed
"Hey Jacqui, Thanks for checking on me. I've had good and bad days. Last two days haven't been particularly good. I'm still not settled and I haven't established a routine and it's getting me in trouble!! For this week, I'm hopping to be able to see a Dr. for my injury and I really hope I can get back to exercising soon cause not being able to do that is really bothering me.",negative
"Hi Jacqui, sorry for the long message :
my main problem is that I have lost my routine and I haven't been able to get it back. I'm in a weird spot right now that I don't know if I'm going back to school or continue my internship for the next semester. It's been like this for at least a month and not knowing + random things happening in between hasn't helped",negative
"On another note, I've been reading about food addiction, and it freaked me out a little that most symptoms I feel I have",negative
"Hi Jacqui, thanks for checking on me. Thinking like a beginner was an interesting subject that I've never practiced before. I have to say the idea might be rather hard for me to implement but I will certainly try. Happy Friday!",positive
"Hey Jacqui, thanks for the msg. I'll go through those units again to remind myself...I've been trying to put myself on track again so the past two days have been good. Have a great night.",positive
"Hi Jacqui, for this week, I'm just trying to figure out the basics, like how to get to my work, when I should wake up or leave, when and where I can work out and etc. Hopefully I can get more done but for now that's my plan",positive
I was actually really scared to do this excersize. but it wasn't too bad. I was a little foxated on my face. I have a bit of a double chin going. Also the acne on my face.,mixed
I still don't like the food planning parts. I like the time aspect. Planning when you will eat but what I will eat is a bit much for me,mixed
I didn't like planning my meals for tomorrow. It gives me more naxiety knowing I have to stick to that plan and if I don't I feel like I failed,negative
my pet rat died and I did poorly on a test,negative
things aren't going well actually. i binged all weekend. I ate until I physically hurt. I just am sick of being fat and having to deal with all of the thoughts of food every single day,negative
probably my weight. It gets in the way of dating. I don't really put myself out there because I feel like guys won't like me in that way,negative
"well I was a little confused about this. being funny makes me feel more confident, exercising (dance and kickboxing) makes me feel more confident, taking care of myself (ie doing my nails, washing my hair, brushing my teeth) makes me feel more confident, and being nice makes me feel good about myself...was that kind of what you were going for?",positive
I liked the section on critical comments...is there a way to get that in a dicument so I can save it,positive
I hsven't really been doing them in order but yesterday I had a brownie and ice cream. i don't really think they seemed forbidden to me they were just foods I wouldn't usually eat in a normal quantity,positive
And this whole time I have been in counseling...also before the program the severity of my binges were way more and they would last longer so I think it has helped,positive
"I thought that the program had some really interesting things to say about automatic thoughts, but I think the concept of tracking them is hard. It's much easier to acknowledge them as they come instead of when prompted.",mixed
"Hi sorry I just got the phone call from the research team. I am so sorry that I have been so MIA. I really hope I didn't mess up anything with the experimental data. Life has just been very hectic- I finished finals, headed home, and have just settled into my summer apartment and summer routine. I will be better about logging in from now on.",mixed
I think that the self-compassion honestly is way easier said than done. It sounds better on paper. I understand what it was trying to say but I think it would be incredibly difficult to implement.,negative
"Hi Jenna! In response to your first message- you're right. I guess I didn't take the components of self esteem to mean things that affect my self esteem either way- I thought it meant more like what makes you feel good about yourself. If I had realized it meant what makes you feel good or bad, I definitely would have selected something body related.",negative
"Hi Jenna- I'm not sure how I feel about a phone call, I'm still feeling out this whole program. Is this something I could type out to you?",negative
"I had a pretty stressful few weeks after spring break, what with having to go back to long distance, 3 huge tests, and dealing with stress in my leadership positions. I lost control of my eating because I ate to comfort myself and to give myself ""rewards"" for making it through the stressful events, which is so gross and maladaptive.",negative
"I definitely have really high expectations for myself- but everything I do feels kind of like high stakes. Every test I take directly contributes to my GPA which contributes to post-grad options, every social interaction I have leads to someone forming an opinion of me, etc. I don't really have time to let my guard down. I would love to learn more about self-compassion but I'm not sure I'm really going to be able to change my thought patterns.",negative
"In response to your second message, I think the app is really helping me control my food intake. I'm also heading out to Ireland for spring break next week, and knowing I have a trip coming up makes it easier to restrict my food intake.",positive
"Yeah we had a great weekend this past weekend, thanks for asking!",positive
Just wanted to say hi! Very excited to work with you through this program!,positive
"I generally don't do Lantern when I am feeling anxious or it is triggering for my ED, so I don't have really concrete things to talk about in those exercises.",negative
Hey Michelle! I have just been really busy. I also kind of forgot about Lantern to be honest. I'm doing EDIOP 3 days per week in addition to seeing my therapist weekly.,negative
"Hi Michelle, I do have a therapist at the Tang center at Berkeley (she's the one who told me about Lantern!)",positive
"Hi Ellen! I had white rice at the dining hall, and it went well while I was there, but I binged when I got back to my room.",mixed
"Hi Ellen, the past few weeks have been incredibly busy with finals and moving out of my dorm, so I haven't made the program a priority unfortunately, but now that I'm on summer vacation I'll be logging on regularly. I don't think I'll be available for a phone call this weekend since I'll be out of town",negative
"Hi Ellen. I don't really like planning out my meals, because I find that when I do I end up binging when I stray just slightly from the plan. I also cannot do so because I don't know what is going to be served in the dining hall.",negative
"I didn't get a chance to have another forbidden food, but it was white bread. The binge didn't have much to do with having white rice, I wanted a snack after dinner and it went wrong. I think part of it was distracted eating, I was thinking about my studying plans for the rest of the night.",negative
"Hi Ellen, I just saw these last messages, because I decided to take a break from the program for spring break. I felt like I needed to get my mind off of it for a while. I'll be continuing this week.",negative
"Hey Ellen, I think with the stress of school and midterms this has just taken a back seat. The program would be helpful if I gave it more priority, but unfortunately I haven't had much time for anything lately. I'm going to try to make my health my #1 priority, but it kind of gets skewed with school breathing down my neck.",negative
"I notice that I compare myself to people around me really often, it's kind of a constant thought. But I usually try to remind myself that comparison is the thief of joy. It takes a bit of work to shift out of ""comparison mode.""",negative
"Hi Ellen, I feel awful after binging and I don't know how to deal with it right now. I don't want this to be a constant in my life anymore and I hate thinking about it, but I feel as though I have to focus on it to recover. I don't want food to be an anxiety in my life, and I don't know how to get better without putting an emphasis on it. But I just end up getting obsessive. I know I didn't answer any of your questions, but I just needed a little rant.",negative
"I love breathing exercises in general. I was introduced them when I began practicing yoga, and breathing exercises kind of connect me to how I feel while practicing when I can't get on my mat.",positive
Feeling in control of my food has a positive effect on my body image. I can't really think of any other triggers besides what I submitted on a previous entry,positive
"I really like it! I didn't mean to take a few day break--I've had some injuries and was in the er for a bit. I'm feeling better now and will hop back on the bandwagon. I've actually been a bit more careful about my food, thanks to this.",mixed
"Hi! I'm not entirely sure what ""flexible with [my] eating"" means...does that mean how often do I allow myself to eat unhealthy foods, or how often to I allow myself to not follow strict dieting rules? Thanks!",none
"Hi! I've been super busy moving out and whatnot! I'm planning on logging in more, though. I plan on using it before I ride every morning :)",mixed
"Hello, I got really sick and wasn't able to eat normally or do HIIT for over a week. I plan to get back down to business and restart my routine today :)",mixed
"Hello, I'm really sorry for not consistently logging on. I plan to do so. I think it would be really helpful right now, as I'm dealing with an astronomical amount of stress right now.",negative
I'm going to set a reminder :),none
I'm generally pretty aware of my emotions :) summer has been pretty stress-free,positive
"I haven't had to try hard to reframe my thoughts at all, which is a nice change! I will check out the board when I have more time, likely tomorrow",positive
Mindfulness meditation and anything that helps me keep track of my habits makes a big difference. That's what I want to really make use of this.,positive
"I generally skip breakfast instead of getting up 10 minutes earlier in order to get to the barn on time. I've eaten breakfast 3 days in a row now, though, and feel a lot better. 3 pm Pacific Time would be great.",positive
I did the body check-in! It's a great tool!,positive
I really liked the techniques,positive
I think that I will have to start using an alarm! I have the best of intentions and then I just forget for that day. I am sorry that I have not been checking in like I should! I have an interview tomorrow so fingers crossed I get it!,mixed
"It really is! Since there is nothing that I can do in that very moment to change my current situation, I find that focusing on improving my stress allows me an escape from the stress. I need something to work on so these past few weeks I have been focusing on my future and how I am going to proceed. Thank you for your kind compliments!",mixed
"Hi Ellen, I have been gone most this week and have not had the opportunity to check in. I am so sorry for the delay! So far I have been doing well and I have noticed a change in my attitude. This is especially noticeable after I finish a breathing exercise!",mixed
Hey Ellen! I wasn't at home very much this weekend so I didn't have a chance to really try my suggestions. I hope that eventually I will be able to stop eating during that time since it is such a trigger. Thank you for getting back with me! I hope you had a good weekend as well!,mixed
Hey Ellen! Its been a crazy week and unfortunately most of it has been depressing news. They decided to go with someone else but the fact that I even made it that far was amazing! I am getting anxious about the program ending because it has been so helpful. And I know that I haven't been as good about logging in as I should be and for that I apologize. Thank you for being patient with me!,mixed
"I am mostly wanting to start eating in the morning. I know it is better for me, but sometimes it makes me nauseated later in the day. It will be a bit of a challenge to find a balance. Thursday at 3 is perfect! I look forward to hearing from you!",negative
Thanks for talking with me Ellen! I really enjoyed talking with you! I really like the body check-in. It feels like I can share the information that I used to input. Hope you have a good weekend!,positive
I am really looking forward to phase II since it will be directed toward maintaining what I have learned. I have been telling so many about the program and I have a few friends who are in the same situation. They are from another college in the area and I was wondering if this program is for any student or for those who attend certain colleges?,positive
"Thank you Ellen! The interview went well, and although I had a few thoughts that kept creeping up I was able to dismiss them and move forward! I am really happy about the progress that I have made and I thank you and Lantern for the opportunity to go through this program! I feel that the techniques and just getting the knowledge out there have been a huge help to me. Thank you!",positive
how often do you respond?,none
Hi Ellen! I signed up and then got overwhelmed by other stuff (I am a PhD student). Sorry about that. But I am here now and am excited about the program.,mixed
"Hi Ellen,
I am in the middle of studying for my comprehensive exams, so I would prefer not to have a phone call. Sorry if that messes up any plan, but I just need to focus on studying right now.",negative
"Hi Ellen! I found it really helpful to intentionally plan out meals and snacks I often let myself get way too hungry and then would binge, but having snacks here and there really helped. There were a couple of times where I deviated from my plan, but I chose other healthy options.",positive
"Hey Ellen, wow I've just seen all the messages you sent me! Thanks for not giving up on me, I'm so sorry I've had gotten back to you life got in the way and I just went back to bad habits and binging, etc. anyway I'd like to give the program another go",mixed
"I don't really get the body part message thing, both of my messages were just angry/hateful",negative
"Oops I forgot I'd committed to that and I weighed myself this morning, even though my weekly weigh-in day is Saturday but shouldn't be too hard to stick to",negative
What do I do after a binge? Like how do I eat the next day? I just ate a whole pint of Ben and jerrys and don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow,negative
"Hi Ellen, thanks for the message, really looking forward to getting stuck into the program! :) the activity makes more sense now, I'll definitely revisit it",positive
I did the Dear Body exercise again and wrote the second message from a more positive perspective and yeah I feel really good about it :),positive
"Ok Thankyou! Yeah that makes sense, although hard to accept when I've struggled with this for so long, I will try my best!",positive
"I had been weighing myself several times a week before though so it'll be interesting to see how weighing myself once a week will make me feel. I'm attempting to lose weight at the moment and sometimes I just can't wait for Saturday to come- I want to see progress now! But I think about food/exercise/weight loss a lot so slowly losing weight is sooooo hard for me, just have to be patient as I want to get into good healthy/regular/binge-free eating habits",positive
"I'm really enjoying the program so far and it helped me recover from my beng and jerry's binge haha In the past 4 weeks that was the only time I've binged! Huge success for me when last year I was binging almost every single day. In part due to this program but also the new healthy habits I've been adopting this year- regular exercise, better food choice/portions and meditation :)",positive
As I live in the dorms at college and eat at the dining halls I can't really plan meals all that much but I have been keeping a food journal for the last month which I find SO helpful and I genuinely enjoy writing down all the nutritious food I'm eating. I also have been tending to look up the menu on our college's app before I eat so I can mentally figure out what I'm going to eat before I go into the dining hall and feel overwhelmed.,positive
"My roommate just received his personal trainer certification (yay him!) and is now trying to help me through my insecurities by encouraging me and showing me the right exercises to do. At this point, I don't feel I can stop comparing myself to others until I am confident in myself. Much of my insecurity is rooted in my physical appearance, and while I know this might not be the right mindset, I don't think I can be confident until I get thinner/more toned.",mixed
"Hi Michelle! Sorry I havnt been regular with this program! About 2 months ago I came off of the Prozac I began taking 3 years ago when I first began treating my eating disorder. Over the past year I have been very forgiving towards myself when I didn't have time to exercise (which was quite a lot), but lately when I don't make it to the gym I become angry with myself. I tend to associate these feelings with my discontinuation symptoms, and I hope to see that they subside with the rest of my symptoms.",mixed
Eating poorly (usually from social events) makes me feel as though I can eat more without making a difference because the damage has already been done. This causes me to eventually feel guilty and restrict. As a result I have been attempting (sometimes unsuccessfully) to eat consistently healthy.,negative
"People don't often give me criticism, but I anticipate what they would say or what I think they are thinking. I probably am assuming the worst, but I feel people judge me on my weight an intelligence which influences my eating behavior.",negative
"I recognize that these things aren't always safe or carefully regulated, which worries me, but somehow not enough to make me stop.",negative
"For the diet pills, I feel it is not directly caused by anything in particular. Rather I find that I take them more if I actually remember to. Meal restricting does seem relevant for the behavior chain though, so I will do that!",none
The more busy I am the less time I have to exercise and actively eat healthy. This usually makes me more self conscious are more willing to compare myself to others. Also when I do poorly in school I feel out of control and attempt to control myself by eating less.,none
"In terms of the diet pills, I'm not really sure when it started. It wasn't something I would do when I was anorexic and underweight but sometime during college it started. I felt I had damaged my metabolism and was unable to loose weight as efficiently on my own so i sought help in this form. I usually take a combination of CLA and a ""burn"" pill for women.",none
"I think I still have this intention, and though I haven't achieved it yet, I think I am getting closer.",positive
Everything is fine! I have just been busy with school! I plan to use it more this week.,positive
I did! it definitely helped to calm me down.,positive
"Hi Bianca, I apologize for my inactivity. It was rude of me to sign up for this program and then not participate in it.",negative
My goal is to now follow through with it.,positive
"Hello Elise! Glad to finally have made my way here. I'm excited to start the process and hopefully be able to change the way I think about my body for the better! I'll be sure to ask away, thank you :)",positive
Thanks - I just think the eating tracking isn't really doing anything beneficial for me anymore so I'm not sure that returning will be helpful,none
Hi - I wanted to ask about the program. I'm starting to feel like my check-ins are redundant and becoming not as relevant to my situation. Is there anything to be done? Thanks!,none
"Thanks, sorry I've been super swamped with work! Maybe we can set up a time to talk - I don't think my going through the preset program route will work for me",none
"Hi - sorry my schedule is crazy hectic so I'm not quite sure when will be a good time. Possibly Saturday? And I still don't feel like some of the stuff has been extremely helpful, although I do like that we're now focusing on body image. I still think the questions regarding laxatives/purging are unnecessary. I think just being more aware and having accountability to the program has helped me lessen my loss of control with eating",none
"I actually had already been doing that before the ""exercise"" so it isn't very uncomfortable for me. I'd been working on looking at myself and forcing myself to think positive instead of negative thoughts",none
Thanks! Still have the same feelings about my needs being more body image based rather than food habit based,none
Hi - I'm thinking I may need to take a break from the program. I feel like in some aspects I'm getting better and a lot of these activities are not relevant anymore.,positive
"Thanks! I'm thinking about starting back up again, but I do feel like the options I selected initially are not really applicable anymore and I may benefit from other tracks of this program. Is there any way for me to update my settings? Thanks",positive
"Hi Myra - thanks for the message. I think just having the exercise themselves, and forcing me to think about different things actively is helpful",positive
I think I'm just going to take some time away and come back if I need it. Thanks though! Have a good Sunday!,positive
"I feel like a have a pretty good knowledge and understanding of healthy eating. Tracking and planning my meals have been really helpful. The meal planning was something I learned from the nutritionist I was seeing. 
But I know that the reason I struggle so much with my weight is because I don't exercise. I've tried to start different exercise regimes at various times and have not been successful. I have a really busy schedule and most of the time I'm too tired to fit it in. I did like the tip to start exercising by paying attention to the frequency instead of the intensity. I think that may be useful to me.",mixed
"I can't say I look forward to any type of workout. Though I do like hiking/walking in nature, swimming, and dancing. And yoga! I think I do best when I work out with a friend. It helps force me to go.",none
"Sometimes I'm not sure whether or not to report ""binging"". There are times in the past I felt like I truly binge ate, like eating a whole bag of cookies or pint of ice cream or stuffed myself with x,y,z without being able to stop. Usually that happens late at night. I used to binge eat in bed sometimes (either sweets, like cookies, or sometimes snacks like Goldfish) but I've tried to curb that since I started seeing a therapist/nutritionist who has helped me identify some over-eating behaviors. 
But there are other times, like last night, where I feel like I continue eating beyond when I felt full. This is why I put that I had 1 episode of binge eating. I ate a big dinner and probably had a bigger portion than I needed, and continued eating even though I felt ""stuffed"". I had some friends over and we were having fish tacos and beans.",none
"Okay yeah a little more -- if I think about it as things I wish I didn't eat, or things I eat un-mindfully, or things I wish I didn't eat so much of afterwards...that resonates with me. So I'd probably change my list then :). Chocolate would be #1, that I wish I could eat more mindfully/with control/moderation, and baked goods would be #2.",mixed
"hi! i never got a call, but i back on here. I just finished the program that i was worried about before in terms of eating because i knew i'd have the feelings of work anxiousness during it. i actually didn't really binge during it at night like I was doing during the school year, so that felt really good, but i did still have the feeling of being out of control of eating in a different way during it. they gave us a certain amount of money to spend each day on bfast and lunch and i felt like i should max out the money with food, so bought as much food as i could with the allowance each meal.",mixed
"Hi! so, the forbidden food thing didn't seem especially relevant to me because I feel like my issue is that i really don't forbid any foods... I listed a few that do give me discomfort when faced with them but they're not foods i crave and don't let myself have. the things i crave, i eat, but often when i'm not hungry or way too much of them. Even in non-binge situations, I don't feel like I have much willingness to say no to a food i want, so it doesn't really seem like i have forbidden foods that i should try eating.. should i try that anyway or should i think about forbidden foods as the things i wish i could say no to but don't, or?",negative
"Thanks! Chocolate chip cookies is probably the one thing I would like to eat regularly but mindfully. Why I want to eat baked goods/sweets less: weight a little bit (I'd like to just maintain the weight I've been at for a few years but I often gain weight when I eat too much baked goods/sweets, and then since I don't feel a ton of control over that, it's hard to get back to normal). And just how it makes me feel after I overeat baked goods/sweets -- i don't feel as healthy and fit and sometimes my stomach hurts and I feel kind of gross if I eat too much of it...",negative
"Many were snacks that weren't necessarily that unhealthy (some were) so that could have been okay, but then i felt like once i had them, i'm completely out of control of when i eat them. so i ate sooo much during the 4 weeks of the program, even when i was completely full, and gained weight. i'm frustrated about that, although it didn't feel as bad mentally as the night-time binging.",negative
"so I don't like that feeling. If I just have a little or have it combined with otherwise healthy eating, then it feels fine. I think the reason I don't binge at home is I rarely binge when I'm around other people, as opposed to being alone.",negative
"I'm not sure -- I want to eat those less often, so I'm not sure how to plan eating them more intentionally, because i eat them all the time. Or those are often the things that I feel sort of out of control eating. I am going home this weekend, which usually means eating a lot of desserts, although also means less binge-ing. Anything I could I do to plan for family desserts and baked goods? My family treats visits like a eat-anything/treat yourself vacation..",none
"Hi! Thank you for checking in and I got the calls as well -- I had a really good habit of when i signed on and then my schedule changed with that really busy program and afterwards, so I just haven't been in the habit of signing on, even though i want to. Back on today and hopefully now will get back on track with it! 
I'm on family vacation now, which is pretty healthy -- I feel like the social aspect of being around other people eating healthily is really good, i don't really snack much if other people aren't snacking, or at least it makes me think twice whether i am really hungry for a snack or not.",positive
"Hi, Thanks! I think my main goal over the next month is to eat what I want to eat, not what's there... meaning, I'm feeling pretty good about not binging or overeating and feeling like I have control over balanced portions lately for the most part (not always), but sometimes with my family around, while I don't snack as much, we serve a lot of food all together and I just eat what's in front of me, even if I know I'm full or don't want the food.",positive
"Hi! the visit home was pretty good, it didn't feel super disruptive to eating habits. I've had a pretty great week or two around that because i had two big athletic challenges 2 weeks apart, and I felt like i was able to think of eating more rationally, that the outcome of eating was more about the races and what my body actually needs and wants, not for weight/image or homework anxiety stuff. it felt like a really nice reset to have an entirely different purpose around eating.",positive
A little overwhelming with the meal planning but I'm excited to put in the effort.,mixed
I have noticed I don't work out as regularly as I would like. I like to exercise during the morning but I have class so by the afternoon I am too tired or have too much to do to get to the gym in the afternoon. So I end up only working out on the weekends. I haven't been receiving the email notifications and am unable to log into the lantern app :-/,negative
"I have had 2 sick girls this week, finding excuses is definitely one of my biggest downfalls. I will try to get back on track after class today.",negative
"Sorry, it's been hard to keep my eating habits relatively healthy and consistent because I'm traveling for vacation. Do you have any tips on maintaining good practices in non-standard environments? I feel like it's easy to do so when my life is fairly consistent but when I have novel situations (parties, traveling), it's much harder. Thanks Anna!",mixed
"I think it's the novelty of all the new foods that gets to me---I've been eating 4+ meals a day recently. They've been delicious, for sure, but I've been getting super antsy about gaining too much weight. I can't tell if the issue is to eat less (my mom has mainly been the one giving me more food than I'd actually want, and I secretly want to eat more so I let her), or to accept that I'm on vacation and to get on track later (this bothers me a bit...)",mixed
"Hi, thanks for the feedback! For restricting, I had overeaten the day before and wasn't feeling particularly hungry (in addition I woke up really late, around lunchtime, since it was a Saturday). In terms of a victory, I think due to stress/lack of a regular sleeping schedule/a changing (slowing?) metabolism throughout college, I ended up gaining a fair amount of weight. The fact that I can tell that the weight is fat rather than muscle or something height-related makes me want to lose weight to get back to where I was freshman year. However, I think that I've established a guilty relationship with food because anytime I end up losing a few pounds some situation results in my binge eating again. I think I have really bipolar, extreme habits---i.e. I'll be extremely healthy and exercise for a few weeks, then there will a period where I overeat (i.e. eating when I'm not hungry) and don't exercise. I want to learn how to maintain the healthy/exercise part of my life. Sorry for the long post!",negative
Thanks Anna! I think I also have to readjust my definition of binging to be more appropriate. Sometimes I eat more than I should but it's not necessarily on the scale of a binge and I feel guilty afterwards...is that something I should be concerned about or is that normal? I think the abnormal thing is how I hyperanalyze the potential effects of that kind of overeating,negative
"I guess I figured that if I had really strong willpower I would be able to resist the temptation of binging or be able to maintain a consistent exercise schedule, and that a failure to do so was a kind of weakness....hmmm in terms of counterarguments I guess people talk about there being a finite amount of willpower so it can be used up before these situations? I'm not entirely sure!",negative
"Hi, the last week has been interesting because I think my eating and exercise schedule got totally upended. Since the semesters ending people keep making restaurant and drink plans so I feel like I've been consuming a lot of calories without time to run. It might be a bit irrational but I'm worried that my progress is slipping! I've also noticed something interesting where lately it's not unhealthy foods that I'll binge on, rather, I gain weight despite eating healthy foods because they're in excessive quantities. How do you advise avoiding that situation? Thanks!",negative
"Hi Anna, no worries, your asking me these questions is forcing me to reflect I think. It might be some sort of paranoia but I feel like my metabolism has slowed down significantly since college started--I feel like I eat much less than I did freshman year but I haven't been able to lose the weight I've gained and sometimes even gain more if I'm not careful! So after days with large meals I feel like I can notice fat in certain body areas or loss of muscle tone if I don't exercise. I hate thinking about it all the time because it's such a brain drain! I realize it's a problem or obsession too but not sure how to break out of it",negative
"I think this week has been better! Meal tracking gets kind of tedious but I am more cognizant of what I do and don't eat. I think I might've also had a ""learned helplessness"" aspect when it comes to being healthy (because of all the times I tried to stick good habits and lapsed), but focusing on small progress rather than trying to fix everything at once has been more encouraging. The past two or three days have been good---for some reason, my appetite has stabilized and I don't think about food as much (I hope this continues!).",positive
"Hey, I was a bit busy the past few days and didn't have a chance to log onto Lantern, but I'll fill out a session now! Eating habits are somewhat stabilized, which is good!",positive
"Hi Anna, thank you for that advice! I had a really good few weeks a month ago where I did this (and had consistent exercise) and felt great, so this is likely the most sustainable long term lifestyle. Even though I'm traveling now, I'll try to start this again tomorrow and maintain it (with some degree of flexibility).",positive
"I had four really good days (Monday-Thursday). I planned my food, ate well, exercised and even ate socially. Today wasn't so great. I had a really important grant due by midnight and I ate for two reasons (1) because I was stressed and (2) to stay awake. I KNOW that eating chocolate blueberries would not help EITHER of those problems and yet I ate like 30 of them anyways. I'm going to try not to feel bad about it and just get back on track tomorrow. I'm visiting my family for some celebrations this weekend :)",mixed
"Hi Dani - I just want to clarify what I wrote with my meal tracking today. When I say that I ""binged"" twice, what I mean is that twice, I ate a full meal of food that I hadn't planned to eat and when I wasn't even hungry. This is free food that was left in the kitchen at my office. This is a behavior that I really want to stop but it happens all the time. I brought good healthy food that I like, and yet I still eat the burritos and chinese food that people leave for us in the office. It's really hard!",negative
Good day yesterday - ate to fuel my body and only when I was hungry. Went grocery shopping last night and bought food that I love for this week!,positive
It's Monday so I finally got to weigh in again (I used to weigh in once a day). After 4 good days and 3 not-so-good days I stayed the exact same weight! I will try to have at least 5 good days this week.,positive
"Hi Elise, thanks for messaging. This week (eating wise) has been super great. I've successfully been quite flexible and quite restrictive in my eating. I've been flexible in that I'm not restricting myself to a low number of calories but I'm still restricting myself to eating food that I think is healthy, delicious, and good for me. I feel good and I'm happy with the results! Hopefully I can keep this up through two more weeks. I'm predicting both high stress and PMS. I will try and anticipate those by upping my calories and flexibility, and planning healthy activities accordingly so I'm less likely to stress-eat.",positive
"Hi Elise, it's wonderful to hear from you. Thanks for checking in. The program has been going well so far - some of the techniques have been really helpful. Simply committing to getting healthier by doing the program every day has changed how I feel about myself and I'm excited to become healthier. Next week would be great to call and check in - perhaps Tuesday or Thursday?",positive
Also - thank you for being a coach in this program - I really hope that I'm able to get healthier in the next ten weeks.,positive
"Hi Elise! Thanks for your message. 1:30PM PST on 16 April, sounds great. I appreciate your feedback regarding my late nights in the office. I live about five minutes away so staying late to work seems like a productive use of my time - (and I think I get more done at the office then I would at home!) but I think you're right and perhaps I can find a better use of my time after 6 or 7 pm. For example, if I got to work early, around 8 am. I could leave around 6 pm and do my exercise in the evening instead of in the morning. I don't think that early mornings in the office would be as ""triggering"" as late nights. Plus, exercising during my ""vulnerable"" time of day would be exactly that type of self-care that today's program talked about - doing something healthy when you're feeling stressed or lonely or anxious. This week, I also planned out my meals and set alarms in my calendar for what to eat and when. This will help me eat more regularly (since I used to try to put off eating as long as possible) and also make eating feel like an OK thing to do. I also bought a toothbrush for my bag so I can brush my teeth after I'm done eating. I'm hoping this will help me realize that I'm done eating and help me evaluate whether or not I'm still hungry, or just want to continue eating. I should brush my teeth more anyway. I will also be eating socially this week (the food I plan), drinking plenty of water, reintroducing healthy carbs (sweet potatoes) and taking my vitamins. With all these ideas, I guess we will have a lot to talk about on Thursday :) Thanks again!",positive
It was really nice to chat with you today Elise - I'm very appreciative of your support in this program. You can call me calipiki23 or Kate if there's a way to save that. Thanks!,positive
"Thanks Elise, today went really well! I'm feeling good about this week.",positive
"I was enjoying this at first but I am having issues staying on track because the phone app does not work. I only have access to Lantern through my computers at work or my ipad. On the bright side, I found that I was much better able to stick to what I said I would eat when I logged it into Lantern ahead of time. But its frustrating that I can't go back and look at what I had entered the day before.",mixed
"Well the main reason was because I couldn't get the app to download on my phone. Having access to it on my phone would make me stay on track a lot more. Also, I just started a practicum for my grad program, on top of my regular job, so I am working 60 hours a week. The good news is because I am so busy I have dedicated sundays to ""meal prep"" so I am choosing healthier options in advance and having them prepped so its easy to eat and ready to go. My breakfast options are not that great and I tend to eat snacks around 10-11am instead but my lunch and dinner meals are hearty and usually contain veggies. 

Thanks for checking in. I really do want to stick with this program because I think I have bad eating habits and I have binged before. I fear that I do not have control of what I eat and will therefore never lose the weight.",mixed
Just checking in. I've consumed almost 1700 calories today and only 16 oz of water. Not great but at least I know what I used to fuel my body today,mixed
"The forbidden foods technique won't help me I don't think. I feel like this is for individuals who have unhealthy relationships with food by restricting. I'm the opposite, I don't restrict anything and end up feeling shameful and guilty after",negative
"I'm sorry I haven't been engaged. I started a 25 hour a week practicum this summer on top of my 40 hour work week and I'm having trouble finding time for anything these days. I decided to start tracking my food again today. I'm aiming for 1500 calories a day but I'm not going to restrict myself for the first week I just want to record everything I eat and really see what type and amounts of food I'm consuming. Food is one of the most predominant thoughts in my head ""when am I going to eat next? When am I going to eat next? Is it time to eat yet?"" And I don't think that's a healthy mindset and it causes me to binge",negative
"I know I might learn this later on...but do you have any tips to avoid eating past being full? I tend to continue eating even when I know I am full. It results in feeling bloated, uncomfortable, sick and its quite embarrassing to just continue picking at my plate when everyone is done.",negative
I consume a lot more sugar than I know I should. Most of my snacks and meals contain a lot of sugar. It's also very difficult for me to stay within my calorie limit.,negative

"Yes! I'm also very picky about breakfast. I actually do not enjoy eating when I wake up, I usually must wait an hour or two. I also do not like sweet breakfast food (cereal, toast with jam, yogurt and fruit) and prefer the hearty meals for breakfast (bacon and eggs, biscuits and gravy) but those are not easy to prepare and reheat.",none
"I just entered today's info. It's my last week of my internship so I've been in a daze lately.

Sorry for the late reply! 
For some reason YouTube won't let me watch your video :/. So if you want you can just message me a little about yourself if you have some time.

"Finally got your video to work! Glad I got to hear a little more about you :)! Meal planning hasn't been hard for me to come up with, however it is hard for me to stick to what I plan on eating. Sometimes towards the end of the day I'll find myself getting upset and wanting to unwind or seek some sort of comfort so I'll end up binging on candy or whatever sweet thing I have near by. I've really been struggling with binging lately and I think it may be stress related since finals and the end of the school year is quickly approaching :/.

I hope your week is off to a good start! I had a great weekend camping with my family and now am back at school working and starting some online summer classes. I have still been keeping to my schedule with working out everyday after work. I must admit it has been a little harder to motivate myself to go this week, but I always feel better after going. My binging seems to not have quite a controls over me at the moment and I am trying to keep positive towards my goals. After talking to you Thursday I believe my activity for that day had to do with binging and it was very insightful. One of the activities involved trying to stick to a certain plan. Some of the plans were drinking more water, thinking before you ate, sticking to a grocery list, and more. I decided to pick the grocery list one because I think if I plan out what I am going to eat it will help me not go overboard and it also will help me with my meal tracker. Well I just thought I would check in with you. Thank you and have a great week.

And I know it has only been two days since I have really been focusing on my goals and going hard on the program, but I already am feeling better and have a fire that seems to be sparked in me. The planning of the meals really helps me nit stray from what I should be eating during the day. Binging is my biggest problem! I never set out to do it, but somehow I let it happen. I don't have a chance to binges during the day because I am at work or busy with other stuff, but it happens at night. I get home and cook a healthy meal, then after I am done I think something sweet or something else sounds good. So I get something then I go back for something else afterwards. It just escalates from there and I get something salty then something sweet until I just can't eat anymore. I feel really bad in the morning and I don't understand why I do it to myself. I am trying everything I can to not do that anymore. I am really just trying to get into a good routine with food and with exercise so it becomes more of a habit. Thank you and have a good evening!

What I have found difficult is my weekends. I feel like a do such a good job on the weekdays when it comes to planning out my meals and eating.

"I actually have an appointment at 3pm so would 4:30pm work for you on Wednesday? I am really looking forward to talking to you about the goals I have and about how this program can help me. One tip that has really stuck out to me is about exercise. I actually just got back from the gym and feel good about what I did. The tip the program gave was it isn't necessarily about how much you do when you start going, but getting into the habit of going as often as you can. I am trying to focus on making exercise a routine at the moment and not focus on how much I can run or how much I can lift. I also like the meal planning concept. I prefer to use my own meal planner called myfitnesspal, but I think the fact the program brought it up was really great. Hope to hear from you soon!

I apologize for not checking in as much! The past few weeks have been very busy for me, but I should not make that an excuse! I should learn how to deal with life when it is busy.

I have not been able to go to the gym quite as much as I was, but I have been exercising with my dumbbells and finding other ways to be productive.

I have big plans for myself now that school is over! I will now have more time to devote to myself and reaching my goals. What really appealed to me about this program was that it was not centered around just losing weight, but also about learning to love yourself no matter what size you are. I also like the tips I have received. They have given me a new perspective on what I originally thought about a topic. Thank you again for continuing to reach out to me. It means a lot having someone check up on me and someone I can talk to through this process.

The main issue I am struggling with these days is that I really want to lose some weight (not much, just about 5 pounds), but it's just really hard to do that knowing that cutting on the amount I eat might cause even more serious binge eating problem later due to the hunger I will feel.

My goals for the program: to make me feel about my body particularly around my size and my limitations and how to not use food as a coping mechanism for when I am feeling depressed and isolated. I guess the main way you can support me is to be vigilant about contacting me I guess--just because this something I avoid and don't want to talk about but I know I need to talk about these things with someone.

I think sometimes it's hard for me to remember that I don't have to restrict myself, but if I choose not to it doesn't make me anxious. I actually feel more relieved.

"I have been much more flexible with my eating, and it's been great. I haven't really needed to pause after dinner as much/ I sort of forgot. I probably should have last night because I had a very unconventional meal in the sense that it was really late and I was more focused on finding free food/leftovers... I think my eyes were bigger than my stomach, but it didn't get out of control because my friends sort of kept me in check-- I could base myself off of what and how much they were eating.",positive
"Hi Alina! It feels nice not thinking about what I can't eat. I think my perspective has changed to just eating whatever feels right. I did choose learn to pause, and I think the best time for me to pause is usually after dinner. I feel like that's usually the time when I'm most likely to cave and eat excessive amounts of unhealthy food, but when I actually think about what my needs are then I'm less tempted to go eat. Thanks for all your support!",positive
"Thanks Alina, everything is going well. I think the best thing for me has been understanding that eating regularly is helpful and not something I need to feel guilty about. Also social activities have not interfered with my eating habits which is good! I feel like I've been more accepting of myself since starting this program, it's changed my mindset to be more positive.",positive
"Thanks Alina, and I think I something was going on with the site because I didn't see that you had sent all of those messages until just now, so I'm sorry about that. I think the meal planning sounds great and I'm definitely down to try it. I might be able to call you tomorrow between 11 and 12. Let me know if that works for you!",positive
"Telling my mom felt good, I felt like I was disappointing her at first. She was surprised that I hadn't told her what had been going on and I think she was a little hurt by it. I think the social support learning points were good for me to read. I definitely keep things from people because I don't want to burden them, but I had't thought about it how my struggles would actually make my relationships stronger. I'll keep that in mind the next time I want to keep everything bottled up. Thanks again Alina!",positive
"Thanks Alina! I weighed myself today and it wasn't awful. I think the number would have bothered me if I hadn't mentally prepared before I weighed myself. I didn't let it affect me negatively which was really good. I think I would like to bring that number down, but I don't want it to consume my life and thoughts. I also finally told my mom about what has been going on and that I've had a problem with binging and throwing up. It felt good to tell her and I think now that she knows, she will be able to help me and encourage better habits with eating.",positive
"Hi Alina - thanks for your message. I'm hoping for this program to get me back on track and back to the weight at which I felt most comfortable and confident. I don't know how much the ""dear body"" exercise did for me - mostly it just reminded me how much I'm not a fan of that part of my body. I am available on the 4th between 4-6 pm PST and on the 8th anytime between 12-3 pm.",mixed
"Either swimming or dancing every day, and doing conditioning every day. I have some stretch marks that have recently appeared that I would love if they disappeared. I'm not really sure what motivates me to exercise. I guess keeping my end goal of my clothes fitting again in mind helps. And honestly seeing pictures of friends at the beach with their bikini bodies is motivation (and simultaneously disheartening) as well",mixed
"Hi Alina, given recent changes in my day to day schedule and a new perspective/regimen, I don't think this program is necessary anymore. Thank you so much for your checkins and encouragement, it's just that the program itself has become more of an inconvenience and source of stress than anything, which isn't what I'd prefer to be surrounding myself with right now. What is the best way to exit the program? Again thank you for all your help, you've been wonderful.",none
Thank you for all of your help and I apologize again for falling off the grid for a while.,none
"Hi Alina, I'm so sorry I haven't been responsive. Life became absolutely insane these past few weeks and all this really got put on the back burner. That being said, I'm not sure this program is right for me at this point in my life. My goal is to lose weight, which of course there isn't actually time for in college, but I think what I need perhaps when the school year ends is a regimented training and eating plan that will get me back to where I am happy and comfortable with myself. Perhaps then this program will come in handy.",none
"Hi hi hi so sorry again. These next couple of weeks are absolutely booked, but I'm hoping to get back on track sometime around mid-June!",none
"The meal planner is not super helpful, because I recently met with a personal trainer who gave me my own specific meal plan to stick to. I've been drinking a ton more water, which has been helping with curbing late afternoon snack cravings and keeping me less hungry.",none
"I was a dancer for 12 years and stopped in the past year, and I miss being in great shape and feeling excellent about myself and like I can do physical activities with my friends. I felt more confident and comfortable in my own skin, and I'd like to feel that way again. I'm afraid I don't really have time to talk on the phone, so this chat works best for me.",none
"Hello! Life is less crazy, and I think it would be a great idea to start this program now. I'd especially like to focus on motivating myself to do some form of exercise every day, which I have struggled with for the past several months. Do you have any recommendations for how to do that? Also, it would be easiest to communicate via this portal instead of over the phone, if that's alright with you.",positive
I know this may sound stupid but eating more than planned scares me a little as I am fearful I may lose control and binge afterwards. I am very comfortable traveling and being away from home but maybe just the adjustment of being in a new place and out of my normal routine has got me off. I definitely have the opportunity to take me time. And I have started to read a book which I am enjoying and think is great way to escape.,mixed
I have been abroad now for about 3 weeks. My exercise routine is completely off and different as I do not have a place to routinely train and stay in shape. I try to run consistently but I am still not burning as much energy as I normally would at a single swimming practice. ( I often do 2 swimming practices a day when I am home or at school.). I am extremely worried about getting back to campus in the fall as a D1 athlete trying to catch back up.,negative
I also went out one night with other from my program to a bar. I felt so bad about drinking too much I made myself purge. I just feel terrible that I don't feel good and happy with my body. I want to accept it and I have been trying so hard with different techniques but I feel like nothing is working.,negative
"I also wanted to ask your advice for the Fourth of July. I will go to a party with my friends and there is sure to be lots of food around and present all day. As well as casual drinking. I am nervous that I will drink too much and lose control, or just be worries about food too much the whole day and have no fun at all. Any advice?",negative
"Sorry I haven't responded I am actually studying abroad in Denmark so staying on top of emails and Internet has been relatively difficult. I have actually had a very difficult past month or so and have been struggling a lot with body image, eating, binging, and performing compensatory behaviors I usually tend to avoid. I am just so frustrated with myself. I don't know what to do.",negative
There are also so many bakery/pastry shops on almost every corner. I walked in to a pastry shop the other day and just bought three pastries and brought them back to my room and ate them all alone. Another example is I just found my self in the kitchen baking cookies one night and then just eating them all as well as much of the batter. I felt so bad about this and I knew I shouldn't have done it and tried to make myself throw up.,negative
I am a college athlete so self-care has been a crucial part of my life since I was very young. I get at least 8 hours of sleep every night and exercise everyday as a part of my training.,none
I tried to eat more at dinner this evening. I did so. And as a result also had 3 cookies for dessert. I don't usually have dessert at all so it's a little upset at my lack of control. But I know that I did only have three cookies and a larger binge didn't happen.,none
Thanks Elise. And when I say restricting I mean that at many of my meals I could definitely eat more. However I consistently met with my nutritionist back home to set up plans for meals and snacks throughout the day. So I am definitely getting enough food. I often hair feel as if I could keep on going. And thank you for your words of encouragement. I never thought I would have any problems with this sort of thing and I feel so luck my to have people that care about me getting better,positive
I know these things take time and am so appreciative of your words of wisdom. I have not purged since the incident I recorded and understand that it is extremely unhealthy and needs to be eliminated. Thanks again Elise. I will stay in touch,positive
Is there any way we can talk at a later time? I'm usually not awake at 8 am. The program has been okay but it's difficult to be committed when I don't have an actual scheduled eating plan. And being home makes it hard to eat well because of family commitments,negative
If I can provide any other feed back to assist in the program I would be happy to.,none
Hi Anna. Thank for your messages. I have just gotten out of school for the semester so everything has been crazy. This program has been pretty helpful in restructuring negative thoughts about body image. The meal planning was particularly helpful in this way by providing a good framework to use with eating. This is not my primary concern as far as mental health concern and am using this program that was suggested by the university counselor as a supplement to ongoing counseling.,none
"Meal planning is hard, because I'm not the one making the meals.",negative
I'm not happy with my grades. Same old sob story but I did well in high school. Not doing so hot right now. :'(,negative
"Yes, you are correct. But I would also like to lose some of the weight I gained during the dreaded ""Freshman 15."" Two months from now, I would like to fit into my jeans again. A realistic action would be to...walk around my neighborhood for thirty minutes. Can I start with just once a week for now? Or three days a week, ten minutes a walk?",none
A few family problems here and there but overall it's been pretty relaxing. I need to make more time for diaphragm breathing.,none
"I just completed the program concerning exercise. I don't like running on a treadmill but it's too hot to run outside, do you have any suggestions? I mainly don't exercise, because it seems time consuming and not fun.",none
"Ablut two years ago. Half of my family thinks I'm fat, the other half not. They're also concerned about their weight.",none

"I am so sorry, I have been busy these past few days and haven't been able to check my email. This Sunday my family and I are going to Mexico for Father's Day and I wont be back till the 25th. I can talk anytime tomorrow, Saturday evening, and any day after the 24th. Again I apologize for missing the other times that you suggested, I am very sorry.",negative
"So, normally when I eat I will limit what I eat, I wont eat any sweets, cake, ice cream, chocolate. And there are days when I just feel really upset about me and I will start to not care anymore and I will eat everything I told myself I wouldn't. But I will eat a lot of food. Sometime people will notice if I eat out with friends, I will get my food and i will scarf it own and they will be amazed how I ate it all so fast. I won't care but eventually I will feel bad about eating so much and most likely skip a meal. I will start to get hungry but if I wait long enough I don't feel hungry anymore and I will go on with my day",none
It does feel out of my control when I do this. I don't know why I do it.,negative
"Or, I'll think: ""I want to have a piece of chocolate"", and I think that sounds reasonable, so I do. But then I end up eating like 5 or 6 pieces instead of just one. It's like I can't help it, even though I know I should be able to stop! I don't know why I can't. I guess that's the kind of thing I'm thinking of when I fill out these survey questions about binges. I just wanted to make sure that's what is meant by binging.",negative
what qualifies as a binge? Eating more than I meant to? Eating more than one serving? Eating when I wasn't hungry?,none
"I'm not sure...I feel like pretty much every day, usually multiple times a day, I eat more than I meant to. I'll sit down to a meal thinking, ""I only want to have one serving"", and then I have two, even though I'm not hungry after one serving. Is this a binge, or is it just habitual overeating?",none
My weight has been going up and down I was at 208.8 last week and today I am back up to 213.2 ugh,negative
"I weigh myself daily but only because i am a part of another study for a friend's school. It is over a course of 4 months...

Yes, i know it fluctuates up to 2 lbs each day, either way. At first, this would impact my day but not anymore. i still try to stick to a healthy diet and i am current not using laxatives because i'm broke.",none
"Nitya, thank you for checking in. The weekend was great, but also very challenging in some respects. I'm feeling overwhelmed to start the week. I have to move out of my house before I leave for a trip with my friends on Wednesday. After i return I will have a better idea of my daily schedule, I'm sorry I can't provide that information now.",mixed

"I'm mainly worried about being able to balance the time devoted to important things in my life. With the addition of the CPA exam, that will leave less time for things like working out, cooking healthy meals and spending time rejuvenating with friends and family. All of these things are important to me, so I think that finding a happy medium between them will be the most challenging thing in the months to come.",none
"Hey Nitya,
Sorry for my absence the last few week. I recently returned from my trip, and would love to chat about how to fit lantern into my schedule. I'm pretty flexible now that things have calmed down and I am finally back home. Sorry again for the lack of responses but I look forward to talking with you soon.",none
"As far as my goals, I feel that I am in a better place now than I have been in a while. Of course, this could be the result of a relatively low-stress period for me. Traveling and being at home make it easy for me to keep my body-related issues at bay, but the goal for the next few months will be to keep it going while I transition into the working lifestyle and the stress that comes with it.",positive
"Thankfully ill be living with a few friends in my new house, so I dont have to go about the entire leasing process alone. They have been great about proactively searching for new places to live and contacting landlords, etc. As for the physical packing/moving, I'll need to ask for help - never an easy thing for me - but I have no reason to believe that my friends wont come through for me. A perfect example of just how much the support from others can help.",positive
"Thanks again for your time Nitya, and I look forward to working with you as well. Im optimistic about the good things to come via this program, and think our weekly check-ins will be a great way to get there.",positive
"Hi Nitya, Sorry for the delayed response. Id love to talk tomorrow morning. I really liked your video, it was a nice personal touch and I look forward to getting to know one another better on our call tomorrow at 8:30!",positive
"Hi Alina....I have been working over time recently. Way over time. I need to find a reasonable way to balance work and life. I also need to incorporate excersize because am starting to feel a ton of aches and pains. But for now, my goal is going to try to get to bed early. Yesterday I dozed off around 11 which is a miracle, I have never slept this early in years.",mixed
"As for the set backs, without dwelling too much on the detail, here is a summary:
1- In February I realized I had cancer.
2- In March had my operation
3- Between March and May I was busy finishing school work.
4- June graduation and graduation blues. Hunting for a job, income = 0 now. 
5- Moved from MA to DC in the beginning of August
6-Homeless between August and November (stayed with a friend). Had few consultancies to support myself but the experience was stressful.
7- Found a part time job in November
8- Starting to feel a bit settled now, moved to my own place.
9- Now realize that job is stressful and that I need to work hard to figure my boss out, which is stressing me out and affecting my eating habit.
10- I have an annoying landlord.

Points 1-8 affected my routine, my food intake, and surely my excerisze. 

Sleep was very poor throughout. 

Alchohol intake is increasing a lot (maybe a glass every other day or so) This is a lot for me as it is starting to get habitual.

My desire to change my weight is not that great. I am significantly over weight, and I think aboutmy weight on a daily basis, but I am scared of having to work hard on this.

That was a long summary! Talk to you on Friday,
Fa",negative
I would love to get started on the program and use it actively...,positive
How was your thanks giving? Things were ok here. I would love to talk to you soon and share with you the set backs that impeded me from pursuing my health recovery issues. I would love to resume using the program again. Let me know if we can talk on the phone or Skype as I have missed talking to you the first time around.,positive
"Hi Alina, Sorry to get back to you so late. I just have so much going on. Yes he new semester has started , but sadly am not taking the same workout class. Also, my work out partner moved away so I feel that I have lost motivation to go work out and be active.",negative
"Hi, my name is Nikki. I was just stopping by to say that I just joined the program today and am looking forward to the next few weeks",positive

I've been really busy as of late as I am leaving tomorrow morning to study abroad at Cambridge in the UK and have been packing running errands etc. I'm currently seeing a social services worker about once a week for my eating disorder and she recommended this program as a way for me to get some ideas and tips remotely since I won't be able to see her for the next two months.",none

"Some distractions that I want to try are reading a book, talking to friends, and going for a walk! Talking to friends/ family is the one that has worked the best so far. 
Doing the forbidden foods exercise made me realize that I don't have very many forbidden foods. I used to avoid carbs and grains (or eat them very sparingly). After I talked to a nutritionist, I realized that healthy grain is good in proportioned amounts. Everything in moderation is my motto currently, haha. I know that it will get tougher when I feel like I am gaining weight, and my first thought is to restrict what I'm eating (but this leads to binging/purging)... I'm still working on it.",mixed
"Yes, it is true that I focus on my body and that I criticize it often. I am seeing a counselor right now, and she said that if I feel a binge/purge coming on, to take a 30 min distraction break and then see how I feel after that. So I think shifting my attention to something else while I am feeling negatively about my body could be helpful!",mixed
"Hi Alina! It was interesting to do the exercise - I rarely think about what it means when I binge/purge, normally I just go on autopilot. I honestly don't know what I could have done differently in the situation. I know that I have a fear sitting in my emotions, and I am working more on that. I'm learning that it's ok to be sad. To lower stress, I can talk about my problems/worries with people because normally that helps. Also running/ exercise helps reduce stress levels for me. I'm excited to continue with the program.",mixed

"Hi Alina, I think I want to do the check-ins in the morning. Thanks! And I don't have a scale at my apartment currently, so I wasn't able to do the weigh in. I sometimes go to the gym and there is a scale there, so I can weigh myself there.",none

As I am starting to track different aspects of my self esteem, I am noticing that my self esteem is tied to body image as well as friendship, intelligence, and spirituality - also when I feel best about those things, I feel best about my body image! I don't know how to shift that balance away from body image, though. Maybe you could help me with that?",none
"Thanks Alina! I have been doing the relaxation techniques, and the breathing ones have helped when I am stressed. Sounds good, hope you have a good two weeks :)",positive
"Hi there- thank you for reaching out to me. To be honest, I didn't know that you were a real person on the other end of this, so my apologies for falling on the wayside. My mind hasn't been in a good place lately, so it's been hard to focus on the better things. But, I'll stick to the program, and hope for the best. Cheers!",mixed
"I think that would be a good idea. Perhaps this weekend, or Monday, we can speak. This Friday I'll actually be on the Stanford campus, so it'll be difficult for me to plan then. I'm basically struggling in trying to find will power to eat healthy.

"Thanks! I've had a hectic few days with moving into college and I've actually been practicing some of the mindfulness techniques I learned here throughout the past few days, and I've found them very helpful.",mixed
I'm not really sure. I guess it would be good for me to tell you that my eating issues aren't the only issues I'm trying to overcome right now. I think I might be depressed or have some kind of emotional problem too and I actually have a therapist appointment next tuesday. I'm really motivated to work on these things and hopefully I'll be able to. I think I'm definitely moving in the right direction.,mixed
"The exposure planning went kind of badly these past couple days. When I allowed myself to eat foods I had originally told myself were ""off limits"" I ended up just completely losing control and bingeing instead of exposing myself to just a little of those foods. Do you have any tips that could help with this?",negative
"On Monday I was having a lot of feelings of low self esteem relating to my body so that's why I didn't eat as much that day. I think I just need to keep reminding myself that I don't have to be perfect, or have the perfect body, in order to be happy.",negative
That's really helpful; thank you! After our phone conversation I took your advice and told my mom about some of the problems I've been struggling with. She's been really supportive and I think I can definitely try that technique with her,positive
"Thanks! I'm definitely going to try to log in at the same time every day, probably at night after I've finished my last meal/snack. Also I'm really loving the mindfulness exercises and I'm gonna try to incorporate mindfulness into my daily routine",positive
Hi! Thank you for checking in! I've been doing okay lately; I think the main reason I haven't been logging in is due to me trying to get adjusted to the new schedules and routines of college life. I'm definitely going to try to make more of an effort to log in though because I know how much this program will be able to help me when I'm facing obstacles.,positive
Thank you for your encouragement! I hope you have a wonderful week as well.,positive
Hi! I think the relaxation breathing techniques on here really helped when I had the urge to binge. I also distracted myself until those feelings passed which I think really helped. And it went really well!,positive
hey! sorry I've been MIA- I've been really sick with the flu and before that had recruitment all day long. I feel like my eating has been doing well- no binging at all but at times I feel like I am not eating enough and am losing weight just because I'm so busy.,mixed
Hi Alina- so sorry I've not been able to reply. I've been at a competition. I'm heading home tomorrow and then will be able to answer your questions and talk more. I'm typing on an iPad-- will definitely message you within the next 48 hours when I'm home. Thanks!!,none
yeah I think that I need to do them when I'm feeling like binging or even before meals. It wouldn't hurt to just set alarms for the week leading up to my period to try these breathing exercises,none
I think that incorporating anti-stress activities into my daily life will really help. I really liked the breathing exercise,positive
Hi! I want to have a career working with athletes- I would even love to open my own high performance center combining technology and exercise science.,positive
I want to work in the field because I want to help people become the best person they can be. I would say that this value is part of my motivation for developing more balanced habits because how could I be teaching them how to live a balanced healthy life if I dont live one myself.,positive
"I started OA last night for the first time and it was amazing. I was with a group of people who REALLY understood me. I also have been going to counseling once a week which I think is helping. Lastly, I have started meditating some so I think these are all benefiting me and are what I contribute to me not binging recently. I hope I can keep it up but last week on Wednesday was the worse binging I have had in awhile and I told myself that was enough and I had to stop, hopefully this time I can stop for good.",mixed
"Thanks Alina, I am trying to learn how to not allow food to rule my life because I revolve EVERYTHING around food, when I will eat, where, with who, I obsess about it and it really sucks. Its affected so many relationships with my family and friends and I am excited to be getting a grip on things
Thanks for keeping in touch, Jess",mixed
"I like to exercise but i tend to obsess over it. Like on days I don't feel good or am lazy I still make myself just because I feel extremely guilty if I don't which is hard to deal with. However, when I am exercising for fun and not trying to make up for over eating I really enjoy it. It helps a lot with my stress and anxiety.",mixed
"Hey Alina. Sorry I haven?t got back to you. My computer hasn't been working and to be honest I have been extremely disappointed with myself. I have been over eating and purging again and for awhile I thought I was getting better. I started going to meditation classes and meeting with a UVM councilor but with all the stress of school starting and such I completely lost it. I've felt pretty hopeless and been very down on myself these past couple of days but I am ready to get back on track. 
I think it will help me to leave this page open in my browser at all times that way I can see it immediately when I open my computer.",negative

Also, I use enimas (laxatives) on occasion BUT it is because since I have been bulimic on and off for so long now I have messed up my digestive track according to my doc and now can not go to the bathroom (#2) on my own typically without an enima or laxitive. I am trying diff foods and such to help this but my doctor said I may need to go to physical therapy to rebuild my muscles in my butt.",negative
"Lets set the phone call up for 11 tomorrow my time so 8 your time. Also, yes I attend Weight Watchers every week. It gives me another group who gets the weight struggle and I find the meetings very helpful. Also, they are big on meal planning and not over eating which has been greatly helpful to me. I find on weeks I miss a meeting I am more likely to overeat, something about being a part of a group and having someone else see my weight pushes me to watch to eat healthy and make good choice for my body because I know when I binge and purge I still for whatever reason seem to put on weight whereas if I eat healthy and workout I tend to lose and feel better.

I have tried talking to family and friends and I always end up frustrated because they just don't fully comprehend or understand my way of acting and thinking around food.

"Hi Neha! Thanks for the check up. I had to check up on a lot of school work. Family meal time was weird. There was active verbal pressure from my aunts and mother to ""eat more"" at dinner, even though they insisted on how careful they were to eat moderately. My mother and aunt made comments through out the day that ""they like my body where it was"" or ""do your best to maintain it."" But the one time I did have a binge did involve drinking, where my boyfriend and I had dinner together at my house, went out for drinks, and then got a 4th meal at in n out. I think the 4th meal was sort of a substitute for a date activity because everything else late at night was closed.... And we weren't able to go out earlier in the day over the spring break week because of family or work obligations.",mixed

"Hi Neha! I think I had 2 binge episodes in the 7 days. One, I had unfortunately drank too much the night before on a nearly empty stomach (timing of a friends flight and us only getting small amounts of bar food).... So I ended up vomitting for the first time since a year ago. The following breakfast I made myself a lot of food to compensate and ate past feeling full (though being nauseous I wasn't sure when full was).",none
"Two, I got a cold so I made myself a large pot of rice porridge with Argula on top and some leftover diced spam from the ""binge"" breakfast earlier in the week. I ate past feeling full but I didn't feel guilty though. I think because I was feeling weak and sick...",none
"It felt easier to eat a little bit ""out of order"" and then by the time I portioned out my meal, I ate the whole thing despite my ""full"" feeling halfway because I had thought the next meal wouldn't come soon",none
"Hey Neha! I did eat afterward but I had a balanced dinner that my friends picked up for me prior to the bar. Otherwise, even today, I had a sangria and set my intention to myself and to my friends that I would be satisfied with 1.5 slices. Compared to before, I think planning ahead and involving others in my eating plan helps me avoid binges under the influence!",positive
"Otherwise, I have really felt control of my eating and understand the feeling of content.",positive
"Overall, since my binging has decreased, and eating hasn't been my only pleasure outside of school to engage in, I am connecting with others in meaningful ways and feeling in more control of my body",positive
"Outside of HBI: I love meditating (specifically: breathe 7 count, hold 7 count, breathe out 7 count). I do before PE class on the mat, while I pray at church, and I'm sure sometime during lectures to re focus my attention. Additionally, I actively practice to be grateful and focus on the positive vibes in my life.",positive
Hopefully this technique would work with my family. But I don't drink often with them,positive
"Otherwise, I felt progress to not over eat at family time, despite with the pressures to eat and outside comments on my body image. But the comments and photos from my spring break made me hyper self conscious about my body (""I felt fat"") during the break and a few days after. However, once I got back to school and had to focus on getting work done, got back to taekwondo, I kind of stopped worry and felt more confident again.",positive

I have fallen behind! I do not like the having to say 4xs a day that I do not like what I look like. I am about to start the self-esteem training which I am sure will not be fun either.

Even when I do get time to myself I stress about the best way to relax knowing I have a million things going. Meditation is fruitless for now since I can never calm my mind. My husband and I have talked about joining the y right down the road from us since it is so close and convenient, but have yet to do it. Food just seems to be my comfort.",negative

"The work is challenging; my school is known for being difficult. However, it stems more from my own scheduling most likely. I like staying busy, and that sometimes translates into overworking myself. Sophomore year I went through a difficult time, probably was depressed, and it severely shook my confidence levels. I had to re-evaluate who I was as a person if I could no longer define myself as I used to. I think that is still reflected now in my academic career. I know I am smart enough, and that I can work hard enough, but I think I am afraid of what will happen if I'm wrong. What if I don't get in to grad school? Then what? I think I sometimes let these fears get in the way of my studies, and of caring.",mixed

I do know that I tend to binge more when I am stressed, up late, or upset. Yesterday I was working on homework/studying from about 3 PM to 7 AM, and just got emotionally worn out. I know good days are when I feel more in control and confident, but I also know that bingeing when I am upset isn't a healthy way to deal with my emotions.",negative
"I think that aiming for small improvements and small commitments may be good. It isn't realistic for me to go out and run six miles tonight. However, it is realistic for me to go for a thirty minute jog (~mile, mile and a half with the warm up). Timely would be a goal of devoting 30 minutes three times a week, and actionable is like avoiding regular soda.",none
"Hey Michelle, I know that stress causes me to binge so it is important to identify sources of stress in my life. If I can recognize that an event is causing stress or potentially will cause stress, I can better address how to manage those stress levels. This way I don't go free range in the kitchen. In the mean time, I can change what food I am eating on a binge, so even if it happens, it happens in a more healthy way. For instance, instead of eating a whole package of wafer cookies, I can eat broccoli or carrots.",positive
"Hey Michelle, 

I apologize, I didn't realize how long it had been since I had replied. For a while my phone was broken, and I forgot that I could access this without the app. 

Since we last spoke I think I have actually been doing relatively okay. I had taken a small break from doing healthy alternatives, and had slipped a bit. 

However, in the last few weeks I have started making an effort to stay hydrated. Last week I think I did a much better job of getting a proper amount of sleep, and besides tonight, I am trying to do that more consistently. 

Yesterday, I went for a run for the first time in a few months. Granted I know these are all baby steps, but as long as I can start following through with them at a more consistent rate, I think that I will be on a good track. Hope you are having a good day!

"Not sure about the binge eating. I don't know if you call it binge eating or just over-eating at meals. Sometimes I only eat what I need, sometimes I skip meals (even though I try to stay consistent...mostly) but when I sit down to eat instead of eating part of my 14 oz ribeye, I'll eat every bit of it because it tastes so good. It's the taste of food I love and just want to eat it all. I also eat fast and need to slow down.",mixed

I would also cook on the weekends to get food weighed up and portioned out for lunches, dinners, etc. I was eating every 3 hours and trying to cut out fats, sugars, salts.

"On Saturday I finally accepted that my previous training plan (HIIT, running, biking) was not working for me. Often times, high intensity workouts left my body in a greater state of physiological stress. I noticed that I still coupled exercise with obtaining a certain image (physical and identity). Over the past two years, I've gotten better at taking rest days but then on some days struggled to really move at all. I truly like all forms of exercise, but my current goal is to table high intensity workouts for a bit, though I'm not sure how long. I guess I'll figure that out later. My goal is to be honest with myself with why I would push myself to exercise. My goal is to move my body in ways to allow me to ""be"" in my body and celebrate it, rather than move it in efforts to exert control or change my body. This look like light runs without trying to reach a weekly mileage, lots of yoga, long walks, casual bike rides, and light weightlifting when I feel like it. 

I've always wanted to be a first-thing-in-the-morning exerciser. I might start taking walks in the morning to set myself up for a calm day. I prefer to exercise in the afternoon and not at all in the late evening, as it keeps me up at night. 

Today I biked to meet up with a dear friend for a really great yoga class, and will take a walk to run some errands and listen to podcasts later today.",mixed

My husband was not actually angry. I assumed because I did not make dinner that he would be. I felt like a no good wife and mother in that situation. My husband being very supportive was not angry and in fact very understanding. It was my negative thoughts that started the spiral.,mixed

Same as looking at a photo of myself, I see all the negatives. It is something I am trying to work on and this exercise will hopefully help.",mixed
I find that I can open up to my husband for help. However I have trouble reaching out to other people. I think because with my mom dieting was always so big for her. It was her whole life. I no longer ask her for help because she had good intentions but she always turned into about her and she would eventually take whatever diet I was on and see who could loose the most weight. I do not have a whole lot of close friends that I can go to for support. So really the only person I feel comfortable opening myself up to is my husband.,mixed

"Hi Anna! It's been a busy few days, so I think I skipped a couple of sessions. But it's good to be back! I really liked the breathing exercise I did today (just counting to five as I breathe normally). I felt more relaxed almost immediately. I also noticed (yippee!!) that I've started pausing to check on how I'm feeling before I eat without even thinking about it. It's becoming natural! So that's something I really appreciate about this program. I've really liked the Breaking the Chain activity here on Lantern. I'm hoping that one will also become natural. Is that going to come up again in the course of the program? I hope you're having a good week! -China",mixed
"Hi Anna, I'm sorry I've been out of contact. There was a busy week, and then another, and then a lazy day or two. I started to do a session. And then it was the mirror one and I didn't have a mirror nearby. But I'm back!
So to go back through your messages, I'm thinking about your question about how clothing affects how I'm feeling about my body. I think that's totally society affecting the way I think. Things will look differently on me. And that's okay. But really I should stop wearing the tight pants that are so popular, and wear things that make me feel literally more comfortable. Again, I'm sorry I've been gone. But I really am back.",mixed
"Hi Anna! I think that when I get stressed out about things (like tests, yay!) I'll definitely use that. It also might help me to do that before I go to sleep so my brain doesn't cycle around and around as I try to fall asleep. I wonder if it would help to do that when I'm feeling particularly low in terms of body image, but I'm not sure I'm at the point where I'd be able to catch that feeling and work with it. 
As for how my perception of my body has changed, I'm not totally sure what's going on, because today I'm back into the ehh, I don't look so good. I mean, I'm not thinking to myself, oh I'm fat. Which is sorta nice. But I am thinking, I'm not super impressed with how I look. I think it's just up and down still. Also, I think a lot of it has to do with the weather right now (as it's beautiful this week!) One thing I've been doing every time I can remember is say ""you're curvy, you're beautiful"" to myself. Maybe that's working. 
I'm sorry this is super long! That's just all my jumbled, crazy, stressed out thoughts right now. 
-China",mixed
"Hi Anna, I really liked that activity. I just hope that I can remember it in the moment. It's be a crazy week so I haven't used the program in a couple days, but I'm glad things are calming down. Thanks for checking on me!",mixed
"Hi Anna! 
I was able to try the mirror-mirror exercise. It was difficult to keep all the thoughts positive, so I started to do it systematically. I gave each body part (or as many as I could think of) a compliment and I worked my way up. Some things were challenging, and I couldn't always come up with unique compliments, and there were a couple parts that I just couldn't. (I'm working on compliments for those.) But that felt good! I tried it again last night when I was laying in bed?kind of a conversation with my body. 
As for the conversations I've been having with people, it's nice to be able to air those feelings so openly. We tell each other when we're having bad days and when we're having good ones. I think it's nice to have people to go to about these feelings. But it was also nice to be around people who were trying so hard to be positive about their bodies. It seems like so many people have such negative things to say about their bodies. And the media doesn't help! I'm so sick of seeing weight loss help every time I open Pinterest. Anyway, I feel like being around that positivity will help me to be positive more consistently. 
As I'm finishing up the unit about body image, the program asked me to let you know what I'll continue. I really like the body check-ins. I think I'll keep doing those, either online or in my head throughout the day. Thanks for everything!

I'm hoping lantern is the kick in the butt I need to follow through my planning each week.",mixed

The good thing is that, even though I have eaten more and felt out of control, it hasn't been as bad as it used to be. I mean that I haven't binged hard like begore, just maybe an extra portion",mixed

"Hi Sarah, I've tried the mindfulness exercises but they don't help me. I've also lost interest in the program because it isn't really tailored to the user. It's more of a general thing.

I'm going to keep tracking and trying, though",negative

So I partly don't eat them because the foods they are in are often unhealthy, but I also don't eat them often for medical reasons. So I don't want to purposefully consume these foods if I don't have to",negative
Most unhealthy foods that I come into contact with have gluten or dairy in them. So since I shouldn't be eating them anyway it provides a convenient excuse to avoid most of them when possible by saying I can't eat them for medical reasons.,negative

"I didn't mind it, I just got a little out of breath actually hahaha! I have used that technique before to try and fall asleep but lately I've been using the sleep talk down rain version and I've been falling asleep quick, getting a good nights sleep",positive
"Oh my gosh, I must have not clicked the button to zero it. I have not vomited! Thank you for your concern, but no I have not, I just didn't click the button right haha!
However, I really like the tracking. I used Weight Watchers in high school so I miss tracking",positive
"Nothing was challenging about Friday! It was good. As for exercise, I think I will set a goal for next week. My days are filled this week :/",positive
"Sorry, this sounds rude haha- I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything",positive
"I'm glad you brought this up. I forget that people portray themselves at their best. Honestly, I just want to try and disconnect from the media sometimes! Maybe I'll try to stay off my phone more :)",positive
"Dear Neha, I am doing alright. I hope you are too. My apologies for a delayed response. I have just been caught up with final semester madness. I really appreciate your concern and look forward to working with you! I will start attending the sessions and will get back to you about any concerns, difficulties I encounter! =)",mixed
"Neha, thanks so much for your response. 
As regards your question, I am in a habit of exercising so when I don't exercise, I feel uneasy. I work out for various reasons. Weight control is one of them. I like to stay fit and work on my stamina. Its also stress relieving for me and I enjoy my time at the gym. 
I feel alright if I go at least 5 days a week. However, if I have been binging, I don't go at all. Because I feel there is no point. Best, Rida.",mixed
"Hey Neha, I was travelling over the last few days so the last three days in terms of eating were a complete mess. Didn't get to exercise either. Binged as well. Had a difficult week in that respect. But now that I am back, I hope to get back on track!",mixed
"Hey Neha! I will try to go through the sessions daily. As regards your question, on a non-binge day, I have around 3 meals which comprise mainly of around 400 calories breakfast including egg, bread and jam or something similar. Then lunch with veggies and rice and sometimes protein. And mostly my dinner is yogurt with fruit and granola. However, i have been trying to up my intake after meeting with a nutritionist. I just did a session on exercising and I was wondering how much exercise in a day and a week is healthy?
Thanks Neha! =)",mixed
Hello Zoe. Sorry I had a very busy week.,negative
Its just that I have really been trying to control what I eat. and I do manage to. Its like I eat very healthy and workout quite a bit for a few days and then lose all control and binge eat for days. I feel that I am unable to control it. Not sure how to go about fixing this.,negative
"Hello Zoe, 
Its nice to hear from you. Thank you.",positive
It made me more self conscious which can be a bad and good thing. But yes I noticed some triggers,mixed
"It was a pretty big salad and I shouldn't have eaten all of it. Plus I forgot to tell them that I didn't want any dressing on it. I'm doing fine, I just don't feel confident about my body to be in an outfit so revealing. Today I'm spending with a friend and we're going to go on a hike, farm, and a lake.",mixed
Just very stressed,negative
"I definitely felt calmer after doing the breathing exercise especially since it was about 20 minutes after a work out and my body was still cooling down. I still don't really understand how the diaphragm breathing exercise works though or I guess ""how I breathe from my diaphragm"". I've been making more plans with friends to go on hikes! its fresh air, good company, and a good way to stay fit especially if I'm not in the mood to go to the gym.",positive
They've been good I would say. Very quick and easy and they make me think about how I'm eating,positive
Saturday I woke up pretty late and had an event to go to where I ate like 4 bags of chips and a Starbucks drink for lunch and after I slept for a while and woke up around 8. Instead of getting food I just went to a friends and hung out there and went back to sleep.,positive
"Sorry I have been unresponsive, I am going to try and be better this week. I usually preplan my meals after I grocery shop to save time and make healthy choices during the week. My biggest problem is finding things to switch up within my diet so I don't get bored and then eat out or buy junk food and binge on it.",mixed
"Hi Emily I am so sorry, school has been hectic and I completely forgot about the phone call. We can schedule another one for sometime soon!
I made kind of a realization today. I binged and wasn't too upset with myself but I know I will be if it turns into a cycle which it usually does but I knew before it happened that it was going to and I actively chose to let it happen when I knew I had the power to stop it. I view being able to binge as having time to relax. I am able to stop myself from binging by thinking about the aftermath and if I have something important that evening or the following morning I am usually able to prevent it from happening because I know that I will be uncomfortable and upset during whatever I have scheduled. I have been insanely stressed with school, tests, my job, and my two internships that I feel like I have had no down time in the last few weeks and I don't see any down time in my immediate future so today in my 4 hours of freedom before my study group met I let myself binge because I intertwine binging on food with relaxing. I was then so unbelievably full and uncomfortable during studying. I often am able to curb the binges by thinking of how it will affect an event in my future but I still associate binging with relaxing and I need to work on breaking that association. I am excited about this epiphany and that is my new goal for this program. What do you think?",mixed
"grocery shopping is usually fine for me as long as i don't go when i am really hungry. i avoid the aisles with all of the chips and snack food and always have a list of what i want to buy/always buy pretty much the same things when i go. I only keep healthy food in the house so when i do binge or want something ""bad"" i have to go out and buy it and when i do that my problem i don't just buy one thing i buy lots and then eat it all at once.",mixed
I often feel Iike I compare my body to others. It's hard to stop doing so when the way an individual presents themself on the outside is so important. I feel like I don't even compare most of the time. But I'm trying to be more realistic about my image and accept my body.,mixed
I like frequent encouraging messages and I am more responsive to concrete questions rather than open ended ones.,none
"Hi Neha! Things are going okay. School is pretty stressful and I have a friend visiting from out of town this weekend, but I think things are ok",mixed
"I really liked that session. I was on a diet my junior year of high school and lost a lot of weight. It was the smallest I've ever been, but ever since then it has backfired on me and I have gained it all back and then some. It is good to know what diets can do.",mixed
"Since I have such a detailed schedule, it shouldn't be too hard to fit this in. I just like to change what I eat based on what I am in the mood for. I really like food and want to enjoy it, and not have to miss out on something because I didn't plan for it. But, I'm going to try it.",positive
"I have really used the planner, and I think that has helped. I used to grab a lot of extra food, because I felt that what I was going to eat wasn't enough. When I type it out, I can see how much food I am truly eating, and how it is enough to satisfy me. I pleased with my progress.",positive
"Sorry about the delayed notice. I am on spring break, so it has been more difficult to be readily available via computer. My weight was 198, so that is good. Things have actually been going well, even though I've been home with a more abundance of food. Overall, I'm happy with how things have been.",positive
Thanks for the ideas!,positive
Eating until I am satisfied and not restricting what I eat. Have a balance between whats good for your body and whats good for you soul i guess,none
"I have tried planning meals and snacks ahead of time in the past, and I try to plan them in my head every day. The issues I have had with planning them is that I usually tend to slip from them, or eat more than I should in the scheduled meal time. I have major anxiety when it comes to handling my logistics. It isn't that I don't have a flexible schedule, it's that the process of integrating anything in and out of it causes me to freak out. I think actually PLANNING my meals rather than thinking of when I will eat will be helpful. A little part of me is debating with this idea because I know with that I won't be able to eat whatever I want when I want. I don't do that anyways, so I'm not sure why that would scare me so much. But yes, I would like to start tracking and planning out my meals down to what I eat and how much. I am free next Friday between 9am to 11am, and then after 4pm. :)",mixed
"Thank you Anna. I totally appreciate that. In fact, just a few minutes ago I was on the phone with my sister who lives in the Santa Cruz California area (a small town called Capitola). I was telling her about my current state of health and this program. She also encouraged me to be more diligent and exercise more often along with this program. Let me know what to do to chat with you to gain that additional strength in working this program and achieve successful progress.",positive
