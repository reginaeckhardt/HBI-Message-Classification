Yesterday and today have been good. My nutritionist gave me an eating plan and although I can't completely stick to it, it kind of gives me directions of how to eat.

For breakfast recently I've been having a whole wheat roll stuffed with almond butter (weird, but it keeps me full through class) and the after-class meal has been very inconsistent. I seem to be on a pattern of eating 4 smaller meals a day, since that's how my schedule works out. I almost always go to the local deli during my lunch break to get a berry-almond milk smoothie (or sometimes a banana-date smoothie), which I'm happy with.

I have been able to identify some of the triggers for the past binge eating with the help of the counselor I mentioned in our phone chat. I have also been trying to be more mindful of my emotions, moods, and reactions. The mindfulness techniques included here are helpful. I have also met with my yoga instructor to talk about additional techniques (e.g. deep breathing, using a mantra) to help handle stress. I have met with a nutritionist to determine if my binge eating were triggered by physiological needs. I have been working towards acceptance of situations that I have no control of and to be more forgiving of my self. Lastly, I have made an intention to go 21 days without binge eating as an attempt to break this habit. I am at day 15 at the moment and still going strong. I hope you had a wonderful weekend.",02:30.4,0,0,0,positive,3,Intervention process,Intervention process,Relationship with the coach,,,,

552,585,50,FALSCH,"Identifying my stressors has been the most important part. The mindfulness and relaxation activities have been most helpful to get me through tough days. I've gotten better about recognizing when I am stressed/anxious. During those instances, I take a break from whatever I'm doing to try do some deep breathing and think positive thoughts.

I haven't weighed myself yet (I don't have a scale in my dorm room, so I have to remember to do it when I'm at the gym), but I'll let you know how that goes. Plus that setup works well with weighing myself regularly without being obsessive about it. I've felt good and I'm doing well. I'm definitely more of a sticking to routines person, so I've tried to keep what I'm eating and when pretty consistent as well as getting to sleep early and making time for my ""self-care"" activities. I have a strong aversion to reaching out to friends or family; it's easier for me to talk to a stranger, but I feel like I'm equipped with the resources to do that if I need to (which I haven't recently).

613,921,68,FALSCH,"Hi Anna! 
I was able to try the mirror-mirror exercise. It was difficult to keep all the thoughts positive, so I started to do it systematically. I gave each body part (or as many as I could think of) a compliment and I worked my way up. Some things were challenging, and I couldn't always come up with unique compliments, and there were a couple parts that I just couldn't. (I'm working on compliments for those.) But that felt good! I tried it again last night when I was laying in bed?kind of a conversation with my body. 
As for the conversations I've been having with people, it's nice to be able to air those feelings so openly. We tell each other when we're having bad days and when we're having good ones. I think it's nice to have people to go to about these feelings. But it was also nice to be around people who were trying so hard to be positive about their bodies. It seems like so many people have such negative things to say about their bodies. And the media doesn't help! I'm so sick of seeing weight loss help every time I open Pinterest. Anyway, I feel like being around that positivity will help me to be positive more consistently. 
As I'm finishing up the unit about body image, the program asked me to let you know what I'll continue. I really like the body check-ins. I think I'll keep doing those, either online or in my head throughout the day. Thanks for everything!

I feel good and I'm happy with the results! Hopefully I can keep this up through two more weeks. I'm predicting both high stress and PMS.

677,691,73,FALSCH,"Hi Elise! Thanks for your message. 1:30PM PST on 16 April, sounds great. I appreciate your feedback regarding my late nights in the office. I live about five minutes away so staying late to work seems like a productive use of my time - (and I think I get more done at the office then I would at home!) but I think you're right and perhaps I can find a better use of my time after 6 or 7 pm. For example, if I got to work early, around 8 am. I could leave around 6 pm and do my exercise in the evening instead of in the morning. I don't think that early mornings in the office would be as ""triggering"" as late nights. Plus, exercising during my ""vulnerable"" time of day would be exactly that type of self-care that today's program talked about - doing something healthy when you're feeling stressed or lonely or anxious. This week, I also planned out my meals and set alarms in my calendar for what to eat and when. This will help me eat more regularly (since I used to try to put off eating as long as possible) and also make eating feel like an OK thing to do. I also bought a toothbrush for my bag so I can brush my teeth after I'm done eating. I'm hoping this will help me realize that I'm done eating and help me evaluate whether or not I'm still hungry, or just want to continue eating. I should brush my teeth more anyway. I will also be eating socially this week (the food I plan), drinking plenty of water, reintroducing healthy carbs (sweet potatoes) and taking my vitamins. With all these ideas, I guess we will have a lot to talk about on Thursday :) Thanks again!",16:36.9,0,0,0,positive,3,Relationship with the coach,Stress/stressors,Intervention process,Symptoms,,,

I am really looking forward to talking to you about the goals I have and about how this program can help me. One tip that has really stuck out to me is about exercise. I actually just got back from the gym and feel good about what I did. The tip the program gave was it isn't necessarily about how much you do when you start going, but getting into the habit of going as often as you can. I am trying to focus on making exercise a routine at the moment and not focus on how much I can run or how much I can lift. I also like the meal planning concept. I prefer to use my own meal planner called myfitnesspal, but I think the fact the program brought it up was really great. Hope to hear from you soon!

I apologize for not checking in as much! The past few weeks have been very busy for me, but I should not make that an excuse! I should learn how to deal with life when it is busy.

I apologize, I didn't realize how long it had been since I had replied. For a while my phone was broken, and I forgot that I could access this without the app. 

Since we last spoke I think I have actually been doing relatively okay. I had taken a small break from doing healthy alternatives, and had slipped a bit. 

However, in the last few weeks I have started making an effort to stay hydrated. Last week I think I did a much better job of getting a proper amount of sleep, and besides tonight, I am trying to do that more consistently. 

Yesterday, I went for a run for the first time in a few months. Granted I know these are all baby steps, but as long as I can start following through with them at a more consistent rate, I think that I will be on a good track. Hope you are having a good day!
