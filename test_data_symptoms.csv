613,921,68,FALSCH,"Hi Anna! 
I was able to try the mirror-mirror exercise. It was difficult to keep all the thoughts positive, so I started to do it systematically. I gave each body part (or as many as I could think of) a compliment and I worked my way up. Some things were challenging, and I couldn't always come up with unique compliments, and there were a couple parts that I just couldn't. (I'm working on compliments for those.) But that felt good! I tried it again last night when I was laying in bed?kind of a conversation with my body. 
As for the conversations I've been having with people, it's nice to be able to air those feelings so openly. We tell each other when we're having bad days and when we're having good ones. I think it's nice to have people to go to about these feelings. But it was also nice to be around people who were trying so hard to be positive about their bodies. It seems like so many people have such negative things to say about their bodies. And the media doesn't help! I'm so sick of seeing weight loss help every time I open Pinterest. Anyway, I feel like being around that positivity will help me to be positive more consistently. 
As I'm finishing up the unit about body image, the program asked me to let you know what I'll continue. I really like the body check-ins. I think I'll keep doing those, either online or in my head throughout the day. Thanks for everything!

Which is sorta nice. But I am thinking, I'm not super impressed with how I look. I think it's just up and down still.

I actually just got back from the gym and feel good about what I did. The tip the program gave was it isn't necessarily about how much you do when you start going, but getting into the habit of going as often as you can. I am trying to focus on making exercise a routine at the moment and not focus on how much I can run or how much I can lift. I also like the meal planning concept. I prefer to use my own meal planner called myfitnesspal, but I think the fact the program brought it up was really great. Hope to hear from you soon!

I apologize, I didn't realize how long it had been since I had replied. For a while my phone was broken, and I forgot that I could access this without the app. 

Since we last spoke I think I have actually been doing relatively okay. I had taken a small break from doing healthy alternatives, and had slipped a bit. 

However, in the last few weeks I have started making an effort to stay hydrated. Last week I think I did a much better job of getting a proper amount of sleep, and besides tonight, I am trying to do that more consistently. 

Yesterday, I went for a run for the first time in a few months. Granted I know these are all baby steps, but as long as I can start following through with them at a more consistent rate, I think that I will be on a good track. Hope you are having a good day!

338,532,51,FALSCH,"Hello Caroline,
Thank you for your message. I am currently on vacation with my family and have tried to be more tuned into my emotional states and behaviors. I've noticed that when I'm particularly distressed by body image and body sensations, I become irritated with those around me and my thoughts gravitate toward isolation and discontent. Yesterday my father remarked at one point that he felt as though I was hostile and angry toward him because I kept expressing that I felt as though he was singling me out and was acting paranoid. I believe that my weight is stable and maybe mildly fluctuating up and down, mainly down a few pounds. I still feel powerful feelings of guilt when I eat and think about the work that I will have to do to make up for the caloric intake in the future. I am not restricting my food intake persay, but I am still attempting to be cautious about the type of food I eat and to some extent the quantity of food I consume. I feel quite uncomfortable when I do not get a high amount of physical activity in, and I feel as though I enjoy feeling lean. I'm not sure which of these feelings about body image are wrong, but when I do things that I feel will make me depart from being ""lean enough"" so-to-speak, I experience a high degree of distress and irritability. I become particularly irritated when I am putting calories in my body that I'm uncertain as to what they will do to me -- extra calories outside of three balanced meals - and when I do not know when I will be able to regulate what those calories will do to me through physical activity and periods of not eating. I have been weighing myself fairly frequently, and notice that I become a little freaked out and depressed when the scale reads a weight higher than anticipated, which for me is anything above 130 pounds at 5'7''. I am working on shifting my mindset toward the number on the scale, but have difficultly controlling how the number makes me feel. I feel as though weight gain is associated with failure and laziness in my mind, and that is why I am experiencing so much distress around eating behavior, weight, body image, etc. Thanks again for your feedback.",21:31.2,0,0,0,negative,1,Symptoms,Network,,,Symptoms,None,None,None,Network,None
339,532,51,FALSCH,"Hi Caroline. I would just like to give you some more background on my situation. I have been struggling with an eating disorder and compulsive ""driven"" exercise for years. I have struggled with binging and purging (through exercise and restriction). I have intrusive thoughts about food which interfere with my ability to concentrate and thrive in other areas of life. I struggle with body image issues, self-confidence, and self-worth, and exercise is a partial personal treatment for these mental frameworks. I have been seeing a psychologist and nutritionist for several years now and I have yet to make significant improvements in improving thought patterns. I have been a runner for several years, and running is my exercise of choice. I do not usually feel like I've exercised enough to feel OK about myself for the day unless I've fit in five to ten miles of running and some push-ups and pull-ups. I also bike and use the elliptical machine when my joints and muscles ache, though I feel that I must do much more of these activities in terms of time than I would devote to running in order to get in an equivalent workout. I have a difficult time taking break days, and feel that I must get in this minimum amount of activity to maintain current weight and muscle mass (even though I am unable to recognize or understand exactly how I look to others; I only know my own standard of how I ought to look). Eating often feels out of control and overwhelming to me, and I feel incredibly self-conscious about eating and how it affects the way I look and feel. I often feel bloated and fat after eating. I very rarely feel satisfied and ready to transition to another activity after meals. After dinnertime in particular, controlling eating becomes a real challenge for me, and this is when I tend to binge on usually cereal, power bars, and sometimes sweets. I've been told that these binges are likely the result of my body trying to make up for caloric deficits very quickly, though they feel very uncomfortable. I should emphasize that I feel very bloated and round around the middle much of the time and feel that this is unfair considering how much work I put into staying trim. I would love your suggestions as to how I can balance healthy eating and exercise. My goal is to be athletic and to feel good about the way I look and feel and to not feel distress when eating.",20:37.2,0,0,0,negative,1,Symptoms,Intervention process,Relationship with the coach,,Symptoms,Relationship,None,None,None,Intervention

483,573,52,FALSCH,"I actually think its more a product of the places where I work with food? Most of the programs I work and study with are really focused on local, sustainable food, building better relationships with the people who bring food to the public. To me its more the appeal of transparency, rather than knowing exactly how many grams of x is in my salad dressing. For other reasons, its just to keep my stomach happy. I was going out for Thai a lot over the past few months, and it turned out that my favorite veggie-rice dish had fish and oyster sauce. I never thought to ask before, since it's not nomally something in vegetable dishes, but the fact that it was non-vegetarian without my knowing explains the stomach aches I was getting.",37:47.0,0,0,0,none,2,Symptoms,,,,Symptoms,None,None,None,None,None

I still think the questions regarding laxatives/purging are unnecessary.

674,691,73,FALSCH,"Hi Elise, thanks for messaging. This week (eating wise) has been super great. I've successfully been quite flexible and quite restrictive in my eating. I've been flexible in that I'm not restricting myself to a low number of calories but I'm still restricting myself to eating food that I think is healthy, delicious, and good for me. I feel good and I'm happy with the results! Hopefully I can keep this up through two more weeks. I'm predicting both high stress and PMS. I will try and anticipate those by upping my calories and flexibility, and planning healthy activities accordingly so I'm less likely to stress-eat.",20:55.1,0,0,0,positive,3,Relationship with the coach,Intervention process,Stress/stressors,Symptoms,Symptoms,Relationship,Stress,None,None,Intervention
677,691,73,FALSCH,"Hi Elise! Thanks for your message. 1:30PM PST on 16 April, sounds great. I appreciate your feedback regarding my late nights in the office. I live about five minutes away so staying late to work seems like a productive use of my time - (and I think I get more done at the office then I would at home!) but I think you're right and perhaps I can find a better use of my time after 6 or 7 pm. For example, if I got to work early, around 8 am. I could leave around 6 pm and do my exercise in the evening instead of in the morning. I don't think that early mornings in the office would be as ""triggering"" as late nights. Plus, exercising during my ""vulnerable"" time of day would be exactly that type of self-care that today's program talked about - doing something healthy when you're feeling stressed or lonely or anxious. This week, I also planned out my meals and set alarms in my calendar for what to eat and when. This will help me eat more regularly (since I used to try to put off eating as long as possible) and also make eating feel like an OK thing to do. I also bought a toothbrush for my bag so I can brush my teeth after I'm done eating. I'm hoping this will help me realize that I'm done eating and help me evaluate whether or not I'm still hungry, or just want to continue eating. I should brush my teeth more anyway. I will also be eating socially this week (the food I plan), drinking plenty of water, reintroducing healthy carbs (sweet potatoes) and taking my vitamins. With all these ideas, I guess we will have a lot to talk about on Thursday :) Thanks again!",16:36.9,0,0,0,positive,3,Relationship with the coach,Stress/stressors,Intervention process,Symptoms,Symptoms,Relationship,Stress,None,None,Intervention
