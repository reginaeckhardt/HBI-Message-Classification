10,507,48,FALSCH,"Thanks for the feedback! I have noticed that I don't binge as much either and I think that's because I'm genuinely happier. I think I tend to binge when I'm stressed or feeling particularly down and I haven't had those feelings very much lately so that helped! Although exams are coming up and I know I'm going to be very stressed out so that will be tough. But I like the grounding techniques and the counting ones a lot so I'll be sure to use them during exam week and hopefully they'll help! The thing about pasta and meat is that I don't consider them forbidden, I love both of those things a lot. Chicken and steak and probably my favorite things to eat! But those are the two types of food that give me the most anxiety when eating and fear of immediate weight gain after eating them, which makes it difficult for me to enjoy them when I do eat them. Honestly I can't remember when that started but for as long as I can remember I've always ordered vegetarian things or not eaten the meat in certain things and I have no idea why! So I guess it just stuck and when I started to get paranoid about my body I guess I figured that if I started eating it now it would make me gain weight. But it helps when I remind myself that I actually do love meat and pasta and they are both okay to eat especially since I don't that often.

19,555,68,FALSCH,"The only problem with my grocery shop choice is that I can seem to make myself eat the carrots and salad. In regards to inncidents that can ""snap"" me out of binging, I have no idea. I know lots of people try/say to go workout when you want to eat, but that doesn't work for me. Or they say to do some sort of activity that distracts you. However, it is very difficult for me to find things to distract me from wanting to eat. Binging to me is literally an adiction, where it's always in the back of my mind at night, no matter what I do, whether its reading, watching tv, homework, cleaning, writing, etc. The plate inncident was different because it was something that had to be cleaned up NOW because otherwise it would harm people living in my apartment, and I was really worried if whether or not I got rid of all the pieces on the floor. Additionally, this week, I made a mini goal to concentrate on eatting better, and didn't excersize. I didn't count calories as much and ate better foods for me and limited my portions and tried not to binge. I binged only three days. The first was because I couldn't sleep due to social anxiety, the second was because my friend took me out to a mexican restaurant and I was starving and I couldn't say no to the chips, and the thrid was becaue I attended an awful work party.

I've identified that ""open kitchen"" situations are much more difficult for me than the dining halls, so that's why I binge more at home than at school.

I never even write them down as avoiding food because they hardly tempt me at this point. Despite my lack of a plan I have incorporated one into my diet and have made improvements regarding my attitude about it: earlier this week, I had a bout of what Vaden believed to be viral gastroenteritis, which is sort of a 24-hour stomach bug that goes away on its own. So I had nausea/vomiting/diarrhea for a day (I know, it was horrible, and I was also on my period at the same time haha) but then to recover they suggest very bland foods so I ate both a donut and mashed potatoes the next day, which was quite unusual and sort of liberating. Then today my roommate asked me if I wanted her to save me a bagel and I said yes, AND I had lemon poppyseed bread at breakfast. I vaguely wonder if I will gain weight if I continue to eat bread, but it's not like I have my ideal body without eating bread for years, so.",06:09.8,0,0,0,mixed,0,Intervention process,Stress/stressors,Symptoms,,Symptoms,Stress,None,None,None

I'm a bit uncomfortable talking over the phone. How about I explain why I'm interested in Lantern and my goals from using it?
In the past year, both my father and brother have been diagnosed with either diabetes or borderline diabetes. I also know my grandfathers on both sides of my family had diabetes. It?s only a matter of time before I get it. And right now, I eat way too much sugar.
I also emotionally eat by binging. When I?m stressed or sad, I eat to get the dopamine to feel better. I?ve done this for probably six years now, but it?s gotten much worse due to various factors such as loss of a social circle and pressure to find a job after I graduate. 
When I entered college I weighed 145 pounds. Now I weigh 160. I?ve gone through bursts to try to loose the weight, but I always end up gaining it back. 
Essentially, I?d like to develop better eating habits so that I 
1. Don?t depend on food for my happiness
2. Prevent disease
3. Loose just a bit to feel more confident in my body.

After talking to you Thursday I believe my activity for that day had to do with binging and it was very insightful. One of the activities involved trying to stick to a certain plan. Some of the plans were drinking more water, thinking before you ate, sticking to a grocery list, and more. I decided to pick the grocery list one because I think if I plan out what I am going to eat it will help me not go overboard and it also will help me with my meal tracker.

I made kind of a realization today. I binged and wasn't too upset with myself but I know I will be if it turns into a cycle which it usually does but I knew before it happened that it was going to and I actively chose to let it happen when I knew I had the power to stop it. I view being able to binge as having time to relax. I am able to stop myself from binging by thinking about the aftermath and if I have something important that evening or the following morning I am usually able to prevent it from happening because I know that I will be uncomfortable and upset during whatever I have scheduled. I have been insanely stressed with school, tests, my job, and my two internships that I feel like I have had no down time in the last few weeks and I don't see any down time in my immediate future so today in my 4 hours of freedom before my study group met I let myself binge because I intertwine binging on food with relaxing. I was then so unbelievably full and uncomfortable during studying. I often am able to curb the binges by thinking of how it will affect an event in my future but I still associate binging with relaxing and I need to work on breaking that association.

I have no idea b/c you're a very sporadic communicator
The on and off communication is kind of driving me crazy, and I don't even want to be friends w/ someone who can't complete a conversation, and gets distracted and then responds 24 hours later. 
If you don't want to talk me to again (ie you decided there's some reason you don't like me), just say so, instead of just randomly ignoring me.
If you do like me (ie you think I'm special), can we talk briefly about how we can communicate in a way that works for both of us? 
I know you had a rough week, so I don't mean to give you a hard time, but there are basic expectations re: communication that are common courtesy. 
I think you're special and there's a bunch of things I want to do with you! And if you have issues w/ me not knowing what I want, exclusivity, or this just being a rebound, could we talk about it? Sort of ironic b/c I've stopped seeing a bunch of people I was seeing so that I could spend more time w/ you, and now you're totally MIA. 
I want to make plans w/ you and when you totally ignore my request to make plans, it's very difficult for the rest of my schedule, and it makes me feel really unloved. I am one of those people who is used to constant affection, but that's what happens in most mature relationships. 
If you wake up at an odd hour again, feel free to call me at any hour - I'll probably be up! I don't like to leave things hanging and would really love to come to a resolution on this one way or another.

245,532,51,FALSCH,"Hello Caroline, Running is my primary form of exercise. I run anywhere from as 25-70 miles per week, and have done so for the past couple years. Running serves as a way to wipe the slate clean so to speak, to burn calories, to be outdoors, to de-stress, to be away from people, to do something physical, to challenge myself not just mentally, etc.. Running serves many purposes for me. I also bike aggressively, use the elliptical machine, row, and do some weight lifting, pull-ups, push-ups, etc. Cardio is definitely my primary form of exercise thought. I experience intense anxiety and irritation when I do not get cardio in even when I plan to take a day off. I have difficulty transitioning after eating to whatever I'm doing next and dealing with intrusive thoughts about food. I often times find myself thinking about food either in the back of my mind or in the front of my mind for much of the day. I also have difficulty distracting myself and re-focusing on something else when caught in these patterned thoughts. I am working on disciplining my mind and learning how to make my behaviors more intentional. I notice that when I feel that my eating is out of control, my irritation and anxiety become even more potent.

255,689,55,FALSCH,"Hi, thanks for the feedback! For restricting, I had overeaten the day before and wasn't feeling particularly hungry (in addition I woke up really late, around lunchtime, since it was a Saturday). In terms of a victory, I think due to stress/lack of a regular sleeping schedule/a changing (slowing?) metabolism throughout college, I ended up gaining a fair amount of weight. The fact that I can tell that the weight is fat rather than muscle or something height-related makes me want to lose weight to get back to where I was freshman year. However, I think that I've established a guilty relationship with food because anytime I end up losing a few pounds some situation results in my binge eating again. I think I have really bipolar, extreme habits---i.e. I'll be extremely healthy and exercise for a few weeks, then there will a period where I overeat (i.e. eating when I'm not hungry) and don't exercise. I want to learn how to maintain the healthy/exercise part of my life.

5- Moved from MA to DC in the beginning of August
6-Homeless between August and November (stayed with a friend). Had few consultancies to support myself but the experience was stressful.
7- Found a part time job in November
8- Starting to feel a bit settled now, moved to my own place.
9- Now realize that job is stressful and that I need to work hard to figure my boss out, which is stressing me out and affecting my eating habit.
10- I have an annoying landlord.

Points 1-8 affected my routine, my food intake, and surely my excerisze. 

Sleep was very poor throughout. 

Alchohol intake is increasing a lot (maybe a glass every other day or so) This is a lot for me as it is starting to get habitual.

I'm still trying to figure the site out, it's kind of confusing but I'm sure it's just because everything is new. I would add my picture if I could figure out how. 

Anyway...I decided to give this a try because I'm feeling overwhelmed and it's bringing me down. I've been working with a psychologist for a year now (my first attempt at therapy). I see her once a week and I don't contact her outside of session. I see a psychiatrist too. I started taking zoloft in January. I'm currently at 200mg.

I live with OCD (it sucks, it really does). I guess I've had it since childhood. I've been going to therapy and taking medication for that and PTSD and whatever else is in my file. I'm feeling stuck. I was doing good for a while but now I'm doing all these new things and it's freaking me out.

I'm trying this for added support, to help myself. I feel like I'm failing. Like I can't fix myself no matter how hard I try. 

This is long, sorry. I'm not sure if you even wanted to know any of this..ugh! This is kind of weird for me.

613,921,68,FALSCH,"Hi Anna! 
I was able to try the mirror-mirror exercise. It was difficult to keep all the thoughts positive, so I started to do it systematically. I gave each body part (or as many as I could think of) a compliment and I worked my way up. Some things were challenging, and I couldn't always come up with unique compliments, and there were a couple parts that I just couldn't. (I'm working on compliments for those.) But that felt good! I tried it again last night when I was laying in bed?kind of a conversation with my body. 
As for the conversations I've been having with people, it's nice to be able to air those feelings so openly. We tell each other when we're having bad days and when we're having good ones. I think it's nice to have people to go to about these feelings. But it was also nice to be around people who were trying so hard to be positive about their bodies. It seems like so many people have such negative things to say about their bodies. And the media doesn't help! I'm so sick of seeing weight loss help every time I open Pinterest. Anyway, I feel like being around that positivity will help me to be positive more consistently. 
As I'm finishing up the unit about body image, the program asked me to let you know what I'll continue. I really like the body check-ins. I think I'll keep doing those, either online or in my head throughout the day. Thanks for everything!
