I have no idea b/c you're a very sporadic communicator
The on and off communication is kind of driving me crazy, and I don't even want to be friends w/ someone who can't complete a conversation, and gets distracted and then responds 24 hours later. 
If you don't want to talk me to again (ie you decided there's some reason you don't like me), just say so, instead of just randomly ignoring me.
If you do like me (ie you think I'm special), can we talk briefly about how we can communicate in a way that works for both of us? 
I know you had a rough week, so I don't mean to give you a hard time, but there are basic expectations re: communication that are common courtesy. 
I think you're special and there's a bunch of things I want to do with you! And if you have issues w/ me not knowing what I want, exclusivity, or this just being a rebound, could we talk about it? Sort of ironic b/c I've stopped seeing a bunch of people I was seeing so that I could spend more time w/ you, and now you're totally MIA. 
I want to make plans w/ you and when you totally ignore my request to make plans, it's very difficult for the rest of my schedule, and it makes me feel really unloved. I am one of those people who is used to constant affection, but that's what happens in most mature relationships. 
If you wake up at an odd hour again, feel free to call me at any hour - I'll probably be up! I don't like to leave things hanging and would really love to come to a resolution on this one way or another. 
Or let me know what time we can talk tomorrow.",37:34.9,0,0,0,mixed,0,Stress/stressors,Network,,,None,Stress,None,None,Network,None

Honestly I can't remember when that started but for as long as I can remember I've always ordered vegetarian things or not eaten the meat in certain things and I have no idea why! So I guess it just stuck and when I started to get paranoid about my body I guess I figured that if I started eating it now it would make me gain weight.

I also emotionally eat by binging. When I?m stressed or sad, I eat to get the dopamine to feel better. I?ve done this for probably six years now, but it?s gotten much worse due to various factors such as loss of a social circle and pressure to find a job after I graduate.

Some of the plans were drinking more water, thinking before you ate, sticking to a grocery list, and more. I decided to pick the grocery list one because I think if I plan out what I am going to eat it will help me not go overboard and it also will help me with my meal tracker. Well I just thought I would check in with you. Thank you and have a great week.

As regards your question, I am in a habit of exercising so when I don't exercise, I feel uneasy. I work out for various reasons. Weight control is one of them. I like to stay fit and work on my stamina. Its also stress relieving for me and I enjoy my time at the gym. 
I feel alright if I go at least 5 days a week. However, if I have been binging, I don't go at all. Because I feel there is no point. Best, Rida.",15:35.4,0,0,0,mixed,0,Relationship with the coach,Symptoms,Stress/stressors,,Symptoms,Stress,Relationship,None,None,None

I made kind of a realization today. I binged and wasn't too upset with myself but I know I will be if it turns into a cycle which it usually does but I knew before it happened that it was going to and I actively chose to let it happen when I knew I had the power to stop it. I view being able to binge as having time to relax. I am able to stop myself from binging by thinking about the aftermath and if I have something important that evening or the following morning I am usually able to prevent it from happening because I know that I will be uncomfortable and upset during whatever I have scheduled. I have been insanely stressed with school, tests, my job, and my two internships that I feel like I have had no down time in the last few weeks and I don't see any down time in my immediate future so today in my 4 hours of freedom before my study group met I let myself binge because I intertwine binging on food with relaxing. I was then so unbelievably full and uncomfortable during studying. I often am able to curb the binges by thinking of how it will affect an event in my future but I still associate binging with relaxing and I need to work on breaking that association. I am excited about this epiphany and that is my new goal for this program.

I don't really know if that worked or whatever but I've stuck to that for a while and it's a hard habit to shake. I've been trying though but I think it might take some time before it really gets better. My body image is really affected by comparing myself to others and how I used to look my senior year of highschool. I have noticed that I'm not scanning my old Facebook photos as much anymore which is really nice. However I live with 8 girls and everyone is very obsessed with looks and the gym and things like that.

Running serves as a way to wipe the slate clean so to speak, to burn calories, to be outdoors, to de-stress, to be away from people, to do something physical, to challenge myself not just mentally, etc.. Running serves many purposes for me.

I experience intense anxiety and irritation when I do not get cardio in even when I plan to take a day off. I have difficulty transitioning after eating to whatever I'm doing next and dealing with intrusive thoughts about food. I often times find myself thinking about food either in the back of my mind or in the front of my mind for much of the day. I also have difficulty distracting myself and re-focusing on something else when caught in these patterned thoughts.

For restricting, I had overeaten the day before and wasn't feeling particularly hungry (in addition I woke up really late, around lunchtime, since it was a Saturday). In terms of a victory, I think due to stress/lack of a regular sleeping schedule/a changing (slowing?) metabolism throughout college, I ended up gaining a fair amount of weight. The fact that I can tell that the weight is fat rather than muscle or something height-related makes me want to lose weight to get back to where I was freshman year. However, I think that I've established a guilty relationship with food because anytime I end up losing a few pounds some situation results in my binge eating again. I think I have really bipolar, extreme habits---i.e. I'll be extremely healthy and exercise for a few weeks, then there will a period where I overeat (i.e. eating when I'm not hungry) and don't exercise.

I'm still trying to figure the site out, it's kind of confusing but I'm sure it's just because everything is new. I would add my picture if I could figure out how. 

Anyway...I decided to give this a try because I'm feeling overwhelmed and it's bringing me down. I've been working with a psychologist for a year now (my first attempt at therapy). I see her once a week and I don't contact her outside of session. I see a psychiatrist too. I started taking zoloft in January. I'm currently at 200mg.

I live with OCD (it sucks, it really does). I guess I've had it since childhood. I've been going to therapy and taking medication for that and PTSD and whatever else is in my file. I'm feeling stuck. I was doing good for a while but now I'm doing all these new things and it's freaking me out.

I'm trying this for added support, to help myself. I feel like I'm failing. Like I can't fix myself no matter how hard I try. 

This is long, sorry. I'm not sure if you even wanted to know any of this..ugh! This is kind of weird for me. 

PS
I don't think my psychologist is doing CBT with me.

Generally, I've found the program very helpful so far and I really appreciate your feedback. You've shared some really valuable observations and insights with me and guided me toward behaviors which might target triggers for chaotic eating and poor body image and self esteem. I find the grounding tools helpful for making me more mindful and aware of my current state of being, emotions, thoughts, and sensations. I continue to struggle with intrusive thoughts about food when trying to do any sort of activity, and find it especially difficult to be in control of my behaviors when I'm not engaged in a specific task. Transitioning from one stage of the day to the next is very challenging. In particular, the first hour or so after a meal poses a big challenge for me and I find myself thinking about how full I feel and how long it will be before I get to eat next. I'm really through with my family having to deal with my behaviors and having so much negative attention focused on me. I'm grateful that there are people who care for me, but I really wish I could just handle personal problems on my own. I really want to return back to a place where I can be steady and utilize all aspects of myself. Right now, I find myself being drained of energy, both physical and mental, much of the time. I also experience boredom when I think I shouldn't, and time often seems to drag by at a glacial pace. I'm really grateful to be with family right now and in the comfort of home.

What I have found difficult is my weekends. I feel like a do such a good job on the weekdays when it comes to planning out my meals and eating.
