700,70,FALSCH,"I know I might learn this later on...but do you have any tips to avoid eating past being full? I tend to continue eating even when I know I am full. It results in feeling bloated, uncomfortable, sick and its quite embarrassing to just continue picking at my plate when everyone is done.",negative,,,,,
700,70,FALSCH,I consume a lot more sugar than I know I should. Most of my snacks and meals contain a lot of sugar. It's also very difficult for me to stay within my calorie limit.,negative,,,,,
700,70,FALSCH,Whenever I'm bored or just plain hungry and thinking of a snack it's usually sugar related. Also I have this expectation that dessert comes after a meal like it completes the meal. 1500 is the number I came to when figuring out how much I need to lose weight while being sedentary,none,,,,,
700,70,FALSCH,"Yes! I'm also very picky about breakfast. I actually do not enjoy eating when I wake up, I usually must wait an hour or two. I also do not like sweet breakfast food (cereal, toast with jam, yogurt and fruit) and prefer the hearty meals for breakfast (bacon and eggs, biscuits and gravy) but those are not easy to prepare and reheat.",none,,,,,
919,70,FALSCH,"Hey Jackie. With the diet pills, I thought for that question it ment in my lifetime. I think it was my first time using latern. So I haven't used those in a couple years. The binging is correct but I am learning to follow the steps lantern has provided and slow down and listen to my body while eating. That really helps. For exercise I only did one time but my friend plans on walking with me 2 to 3 times this week so I have a plan in motion.",none,,,,,
550,70,FALSCH,I will try to go through the modules again and I will keep those resources in mind. Thanks so much!,positive,,,,,
550,70,FALSCH,I would like help with getting to a healthy weight and boosting my self-confidence and self-esteem.,positive,,,,,
550,70,FALSCH,I also sought help from the Student Center and started sessions there also.,positive,,,,,
550,70,FALSCH,I am going to try and focus more on my family than my appearance to help build my self-esteem.,positive,,,,,

700,70,FALSCH,"I just entered today's info. It's my last week of my internship so I've been in a daze lately. I think I've been managing eating better by eating with someone, making healthier choices and staying busy. I've also incorporated oatmeal for breakfast and it helps me feel full the rest of the day",positive,,,,,
691,73,FALSCH,"I had four really good days (Monday-Thursday). I planned my food, ate well, exercised and even ate socially. Today wasn't so great. I had a really important grant due by midnight and I ate for two reasons (1) because I was stressed and (2) to stay awake. I KNOW that eating chocolate blueberries would not help EITHER of those problems and yet I ate like 30 of them anyways. I'm going to try not to feel bad about it and just get back on track tomorrow. I'm visiting my family for some celebrations this weekend :)",mixed,,,,,
684,73,FALSCH,"Okay yeah a little more -- if I think about it as things I wish I didn't eat, or things I eat un-mindfully, or things I wish I didn't eat so much of afterwards...that resonates with me. So I'd probably change my list then :). Chocolate would be #1, that I wish I could eat more mindfully/with control/moderation, and baked goods would be #2.",mixed,,,,,
684,73,FALSCH,"hi! i never got a call, but i back on here. I just finished the program that i was worried about before in terms of eating because i knew i'd have the feelings of work anxiousness during it. i actually didn't really binge during it at night like I was doing during the school year, so that felt really good, but i did still have the feeling of being out of control of eating in a different way during it. they gave us a certain amount of money to spend each day on bfast and lunch and i felt like i should max out the money with food, so bought as much food as i could with the allowance each meal.",mixed,,,,,
731,73,FALSCH,I know this may sound stupid but eating more than planned scares me a little as I am fearful I may lose control and binge afterwards. I am very comfortable traveling and being away from home but maybe just the adjustment of being in a new place and out of my normal routine has got me off. I definitely have the opportunity to take me time. And I have started to read a book which I am enjoying and think is great way to escape.,mixed,,,,,
731,73,FALSCH,I have been abroad now for about 3 weeks. My exercise routine is completely off and different as I do not have a place to routinely train and stay in shape. I try to run consistently but I am still not burning as much energy as I normally would at a single swimming practice. ( I often do 2 swimming practices a day when I am home or at school.). I am extremely worried about getting back to campus in the fall as a D1 athlete trying to catch back up.,negative,,,,,
733,73,FALSCH,Is there any way we can talk at a later time? I'm usually not awake at 8 am. The program has been okay but it's difficult to be committed when I don't have an actual scheduled eating plan. And being home makes it hard to eat well because of family commitments,negative,,,,,
684,73,FALSCH,"Hi! so, the forbidden food thing didn't seem especially relevant to me because I feel like my issue is that i really don't forbid any foods... I listed a few that do give me discomfort when faced with them but they're not foods i crave and don't let myself have. the things i crave, i eat, but often when i'm not hungry or way too much of them. Even in non-binge situations, I don't feel like I have much willingness to say no to a food i want, so it doesn't really seem like i have forbidden foods that i should try eating.. should i try that anyway or should i think about forbidden foods as the things i wish i could say no to but don't, or?",negative,,,,,
684,73,FALSCH,"Thanks! Chocolate chip cookies is probably the one thing I would like to eat regularly but mindfully. Why I want to eat baked goods/sweets less: weight a little bit (I'd like to just maintain the weight I've been at for a few years but I often gain weight when I eat too much baked goods/sweets, and then since I don't feel a ton of control over that, it's hard to get back to normal). And just how it makes me feel after I overeat baked goods/sweets -- i don't feel as healthy and fit and sometimes my stomach hurts and I feel kind of gross if I eat too much of it...",negative,,,,,
684,73,FALSCH,"Many were snacks that weren't necessarily that unhealthy (some were) so that could have been okay, but then i felt like once i had them, i'm completely out of control of when i eat them. so i ate sooo much during the 4 weeks of the program, even when i was completely full, and gained weight. i'm frustrated about that, although it didn't feel as bad mentally as the night-time binging.",negative,,,,,
684,73,FALSCH,"so I don't like that feeling. If I just have a little or have it combined with otherwise healthy eating, then it feels fine. I think the reason I don't binge at home is I rarely binge when I'm around other people, as opposed to being alone.",negative,,,,,
731,73,FALSCH,I also went out one night with other from my program to a bar. I felt so bad about drinking too much I made myself purge. I just feel terrible that I don't feel good and happy with my body. I want to accept it and I have been trying so hard with different techniques but I feel like nothing is working.,negative,,,,,
731,73,FALSCH,"I also wanted to ask your advice for the Fourth of July. I will go to a party with my friends and there is sure to be lots of food around and present all day. As well as casual drinking. I am nervous that I will drink too much and lose control, or just be worries about food too much the whole day and have no fun at all. Any advice?",negative,,,,,
731,73,FALSCH,"Sorry I haven't responded I am actually studying abroad in Denmark so staying on top of emails and Internet has been relatively difficult. I have actually had a very difficult past month or so and have been struggling a lot with body image, eating, binging, and performing compensatory behaviors I usually tend to avoid. I am just so frustrated with myself. I don't know what to do.",negative,,,,,
731,73,FALSCH,There are also so many bakery/pastry shops on almost every corner. I walked in to a pastry shop the other day and just bought three pastries and brought them back to my room and ate them all alone. Another example is I just found my self in the kitchen baking cookies one night and then just eating them all as well as much of the batter. I felt so bad about this and I knew I shouldn't have done it and tried to make myself throw up.,negative,,,,,
731,73,FALSCH,I am a college athlete so self-care has been a crucial part of my life since I was very young. I get at least 8 hours of sleep every night and exercise everyday as a part of my training.,none,,,,,
684,73,FALSCH,"I'm not sure -- I want to eat those less often, so I'm not sure how to plan eating them more intentionally, because i eat them all the time. Or those are often the things that I feel sort of out of control eating. I am going home this weekend, which usually means eating a lot of desserts, although also means less binge-ing. Anything I could I do to plan for family desserts and baked goods? My family treats visits like a eat-anything/treat yourself vacation..",none,,,,,
731,73,FALSCH,I tried to eat more at dinner this evening. I did so. And as a result also had 3 cookies for dessert. I don't usually have dessert at all so it's a little upset at my lack of control. But I know that I did only have three cookies and a larger binge didn't happen.,none,,,,,
691,73,FALSCH,Good day yesterday - ate to fuel my body and only when I was hungry. Went grocery shopping last night and bought food that I love for this week!,positive,,,,,
691,73,FALSCH,It's Monday so I finally got to weigh in again (I used to weigh in once a day). After 4 good days and 3 not-so-good days I stayed the exact same weight! I will try to have at least 5 good days this week.,positive,,,,,
684,73,FALSCH,"Hi! Thank you for checking in and I got the calls as well -- I had a really good habit of when i signed on and then my schedule changed with that really busy program and afterwards, so I just haven't been in the habit of signing on, even though i want to. Back on today and hopefully now will get back on track with it! 
I'm on family vacation now, which is pretty healthy -- I feel like the social aspect of being around other people eating healthily is really good, i don't really snack much if other people aren't snacking, or at least it makes me think twice whether i am really hungry for a snack or not.",positive,,,,,
691,73,FALSCH,"Hi Elise, thanks for messaging. This week (eating wise) has been super great. I've successfully been quite flexible and quite restrictive in my eating. I've been flexible in that I'm not restricting myself to a low number of calories but I'm still restricting myself to eating food that I think is healthy, delicious, and good for me. I feel good and I'm happy with the results! Hopefully I can keep this up through two more weeks. I'm predicting both high stress and PMS. I will try and anticipate those by upping my calories and flexibility, and planning healthy activities accordingly so I'm less likely to stress-eat.",positive,,,,,
691,73,FALSCH,"Hi Elise, it's wonderful to hear from you. Thanks for checking in. The program has been going well so far - some of the techniques have been really helpful. Simply committing to getting healthier by doing the program every day has changed how I feel about myself and I'm excited to become healthier. Next week would be great to call and check in - perhaps Tuesday or Thursday?",positive,,,,,
691,73,FALSCH,"Hi Elise! Thanks for your message. 1:30PM PST on 16 April, sounds great. I appreciate your feedback regarding my late nights in the office. I live about five minutes away so staying late to work seems like a productive use of my time - (and I think I get more done at the office then I would at home!) but I think you're right and perhaps I can find a better use of my time after 6 or 7 pm. For example, if I got to work early, around 8 am. I could leave around 6 pm and do my exercise in the evening instead of in the morning. I don't think that early mornings in the office would be as ""triggering"" as late nights. Plus, exercising during my ""vulnerable"" time of day would be exactly that type of self-care that today's program talked about - doing something healthy when you're feeling stressed or lonely or anxious. This week, I also planned out my meals and set alarms in my calendar for what to eat and when. This will help me eat more regularly (since I used to try to put off eating as long as possible) and also make eating feel like an OK thing to do. I also bought a toothbrush for my bag so I can brush my teeth after I'm done eating. I'm hoping this will help me realize that I'm done eating and help me evaluate whether or not I'm still hungry, or just want to continue eating. I should brush my teeth more anyway. I will also be eating socially this week (the food I plan), drinking plenty of water, reintroducing healthy carbs (sweet potatoes) and taking my vitamins. With all these ideas, I guess we will have a lot to talk about on Thursday :) Thanks again!",positive,,,,,
691,73,FALSCH,It was really nice to chat with you today Elise - I'm very appreciative of your support in this program. You can call me calipiki23 or Kate if there's a way to save that. Thanks!,positive,,,,,
691,73,FALSCH,"Thanks Elise, today went really well! I'm feeling good about this week.",positive,,,,,
731,73,FALSCH,Thanks Elise. And when I say restricting I mean that at many of my meals I could definitely eat more. However I consistently met with my nutritionist back home to set up plans for meals and snacks throughout the day. So I am definitely getting enough food. I often hair feel as if I could keep on going. And thank you for your words of encouragement. I never thought I would have any problems with this sort of thing and I feel so luck my to have people that care about me getting better,positive,,,,,
731,73,FALSCH,I know these things take time and am so appreciative of your words of wisdom. I have not purged since the incident I recorded and understand that it is extremely unhealthy and needs to be eliminated. Thanks again Elise. I will stay in touch,positive,,,,,
674,73,FALSCH,"Hello Elise! Glad to finally have made my way here. I'm excited to start the process and hopefully be able to change the way I think about my body for the better! I'll be sure to ask away, thank you :)",positive,,,,,
684,73,FALSCH,"Hi, Thanks! I think my main goal over the next month is to eat what I want to eat, not what's there... meaning, I'm feeling pretty good about not binging or overeating and feeling like I have control over balanced portions lately for the most part (not always), but sometimes with my family around, while I don't snack as much, we serve a lot of food all together and I just eat what's in front of me, even if I know I'm full or don't want the food.",positive,,,,,
684,73,FALSCH,"Hi! the visit home was pretty good, it didn't feel super disruptive to eating habits. I've had a pretty great week or two around that because i had two big athletic challenges 2 weeks apart, and I felt like i was able to think of eating more rationally, that the outcome of eating was more about the races and what my body actually needs and wants, not for weight/image or homework anxiety stuff. it felt like a really nice reset to have an entirely different purpose around eating.",positive,,,,,
752,74,FALSCH,"Also, this week is way too hectic for me to plan meals, is there any way to start next week? Sorry, I didn't realize that it would be part of the exercise. I love the concept but am super overwhelmed.",mixed,,,,,
751,74,FALSCH,"Hi there- thank you for reaching out to me. To be honest, I didn't know that you were a real person on the other end of this, so my apologies for falling on the wayside. My mind hasn't been in a good place lately, so it's been hard to focus on the better things. But, I'll stick to the program, and hope for the best. Cheers!",mixed,,,,,
752,74,FALSCH,"Hi Bianca, Thanks for checking in. I've been traveling. Is the whole program meal planning? I'm so sorry I work full-time and have a super busy Summer, I didn't realize how much work this would be. I frankly am just on-the-go so much it is unrealistic for me to predict what I'll eat day to day and I feel really awful when I can't adhere to the program.",negative,,,,,
673,74,FALSCH,"Hi Bianca, I apologize for my inactivity. It was rude of me to sign up for this program and then not participate in it.",negative,,,,,
738,74,FALSCH,"I am so sorry, I have been busy these past few days and haven't been able to check my email. This Sunday my family and I are going to Mexico for Father's Day and I wont be back till the 25th. I can talk anytime tomorrow, Saturday evening, and any day after the 24th. Again I apologize for missing the other times that you suggested, I am very sorry.",negative,,,,,
739,74,FALSCH,It does feel out of my control when I do this. I don't know why I do it.,negative,,,,,
739,74,FALSCH,"Or, I'll think: ""I want to have a piece of chocolate"", and I think that sounds reasonable, so I do. But then I end up eating like 5 or 6 pieces instead of just one. It's like I can't help it, even though I know I should be able to stop! I don't know why I can't. I guess that's the kind of thing I'm thinking of when I fill out these survey questions about binges. I just wanted to make sure that's what is meant by binging.",negative,,,,,
740,74,FALSCH,My weight has been going up and down I was at 208.8 last week and today I am back up to 213.2 ugh,negative,,,,,
751,74,FALSCH,"I think that would be a good idea. Perhaps this weekend, or Monday, we can speak. This Friday I'll actually be on the Stanford campus, so it'll be difficult for me to plan then. I'm basically struggling in trying to find will power to eat healthy. I found a diet that worked for me, I started losing weight, but then as soon as something gets me down, I immediately revert to old habits, and the weight comes back. I want to make this as a permanent lifestyle change, but I feel like I lack the willpower...",negative,,,,,
740,74,FALSCH,"I weigh myself daily but only because i am a part of another study for a friend's school. It is over a course of 4 months...

Yes, i know it fluctuates up to 2 lbs each day, either way. At first, this would impact my day but not anymore. i still try to stick to a healthy diet and i am current not using laxatives because i'm broke.",none,,,,,
752,74,FALSCH,"They're okay, I frankly totally forgot about the program. Thanks for the reminder!",none,,,,,
738,74,FALSCH,"So, normally when I eat I will limit what I eat, I wont eat any sweets, cake, ice cream, chocolate. And there are days when I just feel really upset about me and I will start to not care anymore and I will eat everything I told myself I wouldn't. But I will eat a lot of food. Sometime people will notice if I eat out with friends, I will get my food and i will scarf it own and they will be amazed how I ate it all so fast. I won't care but eventually I will feel bad about eating so much and most likely skip a meal. I will start to get hungry but if I wait long enough I don't feel hungry anymore and I will go on with my day",none,,,,,
739,74,FALSCH,what qualifies as a binge? Eating more than I meant to? Eating more than one serving? Eating when I wasn't hungry?,none,,,,,
739,74,FALSCH,"I'm not sure...I feel like pretty much every day, usually multiple times a day, I eat more than I meant to. I'll sit down to a meal thinking, ""I only want to have one serving"", and then I have two, even though I'm not hungry after one serving. Is this a binge, or is it just habitual overeating?",none,,,,,
673,74,FALSCH,My goal is to now follow through with it.,positive,,,,,
725,75,FALSCH,"Hi Alina - thanks for your message. I'm hoping for this program to get me back on track and back to the weight at which I felt most comfortable and confident. I don't know how much the ""dear body"" exercise did for me - mostly it just reminded me how much I'm not a fan of that part of my body. I am available on the 4th between 4-6 pm PST and on the 8th anytime between 12-3 pm.",mixed,,,,,
749,75,FALSCH,"Some distractions that I want to try are reading a book, talking to friends, and going for a walk! Talking to friends/ family is the one that has worked the best so far. 
Doing the forbidden foods exercise made me realize that I don't have very many forbidden foods. I used to avoid carbs and grains (or eat them very sparingly). After I talked to a nutritionist, I realized that healthy grain is good in proportioned amounts. Everything in moderation is my motto currently, haha. I know that it will get tougher when I feel like I am gaining weight, and my first thought is to restrict what I'm eating (but this leads to binging/purging)... I'm still working on it.",mixed,,,,,
749,75,FALSCH,"Yes, it is true that I focus on my body and that I criticize it often. I am seeing a counselor right now, and she said that if I feel a binge/purge coming on, to take a 30 min distraction break and then see how I feel after that. So I think shifting my attention to something else while I am feeling negatively about my body could be helpful!",mixed,,,,,
725,75,FALSCH,"Either swimming or dancing every day, and doing conditioning every day. I have some stretch marks that have recently appeared that I would love if they disappeared. I'm not really sure what motivates me to exercise. I guess keeping my end goal of my clothes fitting again in mind helps. And honestly seeing pictures of friends at the beach with their bikini bodies is motivation (and simultaneously disheartening) as well",mixed,,,,,
721,75,FALSCH,I found three-four friends who have a similar problem as I do and found it pretty helpful and comforting to talk to them. I have also kind of told this to my mom although she doesn't fully understand it.,mixed,,,,,
760,75,FALSCH,"I started OA last night for the first time and it was amazing. I was with a group of people who REALLY understood me. I also have been going to counseling once a week which I think is helping. Lastly, I have started meditating some so I think these are all benefiting me and are what I contribute to me not binging recently. I hope I can keep it up but last week on Wednesday was the worse binging I have had in awhile and I told myself that was enough and I had to stop, hopefully this time I can stop for good.",mixed,,,,,
745,75,FALSCH,also im really sorry for such spotty replies and my half-hearted participation in this program - i really appreciate your persistence as you continue to message me and express the desire to help me keep a positive outlook on my ED despite how difficult i am being,mixed,,,,,
760,75,FALSCH,"Thanks Alina, I am trying to learn how to not allow food to rule my life because I revolve EVERYTHING around food, when I will eat, where, with who, I obsess about it and it really sucks. Its affected so many relationships with my family and friends and I am excited to be getting a grip on things
Thanks for keeping in touch, Jess",mixed,,,,,
743,75,FALSCH,"Hi Alina....I have been working over time recently. Way over time. I need to find a reasonable way to balance work and life. I also need to incorporate excersize because am starting to feel a ton of aches and pains. But for now, my goal is going to try to get to bed early. Yesterday I dozed off around 11 which is a miracle, I have never slept this early in years.",mixed,,,,,
759,75,FALSCH,hey! sorry I've been MIA- I've been really sick with the flu and before that had recruitment all day long. I feel like my eating has been doing well- no binging at all but at times I feel like I am not eating enough and am losing weight just because I'm so busy.,mixed,,,,,
723,75,FALSCH,My goals for the program: to make me feel about my body particularly around my size and my limitations and how to not use food as a coping mechanism for when I am feeling depressed and isolated. I guess the main way you can support me is to be vigilant about contacting me I guess--just because this something I avoid and don't want to talk about but I know I need to talk about these things with someone. So just your listening ear and then figuring out what exercises and things can best work for me moving forward.,mixed,,,,,
724,75,FALSCH,"Something I'm struggling with right now is weighing myself. I'm scared to get on the scale because I don't want to be mad at myself. I feel like I'm healthier just because I have been eating more regularly and I've been feeling good about what I've been eating, so I don't want to ruin that by seeing that I weigh more than I think I should.",mixed,,,,,
724,75,FALSCH,"Hi Alina, Thanks for checking in with me. I think the tools are helping me to realize exactly why I feel so bad about myself and I agree that the ""break the chain"" exercise will be good for weighing myself. I think I'm going to weigh myself tomorrow and just try to keep the positive vibes flowing regardless of what number I see.",mixed,,,,,
724,75,FALSCH,"Hi Alina!
I think sometimes it's hard for me to remember that I don't have to restrict myself, but if I choose not to it doesn't make me anxious. I actually feel more relieved. I get anxious when I want to keep eating, I stop and pause to convince myself that I'm full, but it takes a lot of will power to keep myself from bingeing. As for the relaxation tools, I think I don't have the right mindset when I'm using them and that's why they aren't working for me. To be honest I think the first breathing exercise would be more effective if I wasn't having allergy problems right now haha.",mixed,,,,,
749,75,FALSCH,"Hi Alina! It was interesting to do the exercise - I rarely think about what it means when I binge/purge, normally I just go on autopilot. I honestly don't know what I could have done differently in the situation. I know that I have a fear sitting in my emotions, and I am working more on that. I'm learning that it's ok to be sad. To lower stress, I can talk about my problems/worries with people because normally that helps. Also running/ exercise helps reduce stress levels for me. I'm excited to continue with the program.",mixed,,,,,
760,75,FALSCH,"I like to exercise but i tend to obsess over it. Like on days I don't feel good or am lazy I still make myself just because I feel extremely guilty if I don't which is hard to deal with. However, when I am exercising for fun and not trying to make up for over eating I really enjoy it. It helps a lot with my stress and anxiety.",mixed,,,,,
720,75,FALSCH,"How many more of those ""relaxation"" thing will I have? I stop for weeks because I really don't like them.",negative,,,,,
723,75,FALSCH,"I find these tools to not be useful to me right now since I am living on campus with a dining hall. Once I go back home and have my own apartment I think planning my meals with these tools will be more successful--hence why I usually type something non-descriptive or type ""IDK"" because I usually don't",negative,,,,,
749,75,FALSCH,"Hi Alina, thank you for letting me know. I didn't realize that the program ends after 8 months, (but that makes sense). I will make sure to make some notes, and I am sad that I didn't make it through more of the program!",negative,,,,,

743,75,FALSCH,"As for the set backs, without dwelling too much on the detail, here is a summary:
1- In February I realized I had cancer.
2- In March had my operation
3- Between March and May I was busy finishing school work.
4- June graduation and graduation blues. Hunting for a job, income = 0 now. 
5- Moved from MA to DC in the beginning of August
6-Homeless between August and November (stayed with a friend). Had few consultancies to support myself but the experience was stressful.
7- Found a part time job in November
8- Starting to feel a bit settled now, moved to my own place.
9- Now realize that job is stressful and that I need to work hard to figure my boss out, which is stressing me out and affecting my eating habit.
10- I have an annoying landlord.

Points 1-8 affected my routine, my food intake, and surely my excerisze. 

Sleep was very poor throughout. 

Alchohol intake is increasing a lot (maybe a glass every other day or so) This is a lot for me as it is starting to get habitual.

My desire to change my weight is not that great. I am significantly over weight, and I think aboutmy weight on a daily basis, but I am scared of having to work hard on this.

That was a long summary! Talk to you on Friday,
Fa",negative,,,,,
721,75,FALSCH,"Hi Alina, I know that this is a very gradual, long-term process, and I would love to continue the program with you. The main issue I am struggling with these days is that I really want to lose some weight (not much, just about 5 pounds), but it's just really hard to do that knowing that cutting on the amount I eat might cause even more serious binge eating problem later due to the hunger I will feel. Because of that, I feel hopeless about getting on diet and being healthy. What should I do in this case?",negative,,,,,

I find on weeks I miss a meeting I am more likely to overeat, something about being a part of a group and having someone else see my weight pushes me to watch to eat healthy and make good choice for my body because I know when I binge and purge I still for whatever reason seem to put on weight whereas if I eat healthy and workout I tend to lose and feel better.

My mother and aunt made comments through out the day that ""they like my body where it was"" or ""do your best to maintain it."" But the one time I did have a binge did involve drinking, where my boyfriend and I had dinner together at my house, went out for drinks, and then got a 4th meal at in n out.

1055,81,FALSCH,"I have tried planning meals and snacks ahead of time in the past, and I try to plan them in my head every day. The issues I have had with planning them is that I usually tend to slip from them, or eat more than I should in the scheduled meal time. I have major anxiety when it comes to handling my logistics. It isn't that I don't have a flexible schedule, it's that the process of integrating anything in and out of it causes me to freak out. I think actually PLANNING my meals rather than thinking of when I will eat will be helpful. A little part of me is debating with this idea because I know with that I won't be able to eat whatever I want when I want. I don't do that anyways, so I'm not sure why that would scare me so much. But yes, I would like to start tracking and planning out my meals down to what I eat and how much. I am free next Friday between 9am to 11am, and then after 4pm. :)",mixed,,,,,
880,81,FALSCH,I have fallen behind! I do not like the having to say 4xs a day that I do not like what I look like. I am about to start the self-esteem training which I am sure will not be fun either. Hopefully I will not have to be reminded often that I still feel bad about how I look. I am going into final projects/presentations/papers for the next 1.5 weeks. Should be an interesting time!,negative,,,,,
880,81,FALSCH,"The self-esteem training made me feel sad because I couldn't come up with more than three areas that are positive. I know I should be able to have more, I just don't.",negative,,,,,
880,81,FALSCH,"I really don't know where to start on that since I have never really been good at it. I guess planning my meals at least a day in advance. Also, not knowing where you are based I was planning on calling at 3 pm central time.",negative,,,,,
880,81,FALSCH,Thank you Katie! I have been desperately writing finals. I am so sorry that I have not been as active on here as I know I should be. My last paper is due Tuesday! When finished I will have written about 60 pages. Then a needed break and into qualifying exam in early January! I will try to better track and do the sessions in my writing breaks!,negative,,,,,
895,81,FALSCH,"I'm sorry I haven't checked in for quite a while. I had finals and then started winter break. I didn't realize how stressed I would be during this period of time and how badly my depression and anxiety would have been. I am planning to start checking in from now on since school is starting soon and I have realized I need a bit of structure in my life and this is helping me regain control of my body and my life style choices. I will set time out for myself to complete this process and I thank you for not giving up on me, even though I had on myself.",negative,,,,,
916,81,FALSCH,i will not be able to get on for a couple days due to a family member passing i will be back on when i am able to,negative,,,,,
880,81,FALSCH,"I think what's not stressing me out would be a shorter answer, lol. I juggle a lot between having two young kids, a husband that seems to have no interest in valuing cleanliness and has a hectic schedule in his own right, dedicating myself to the PhD program and assistantship, and trying to subsist on half the salary we used to. Even when I do get time to myself I stress about the best way to relax knowing I have a million things going. Meditation is fruitless for now since I can never calm my mind. My husband and I have talked about joining the y right down the road from us since it is so close and convenient, but have yet to do it. Food just seems to be my comfort.",negative,,,,,
880,81,FALSCH,"Hi Katie, I'm in the middle of quals right now. I have until the 19th to finish my writing. Things just seem to go from stressful to stressful. Can't wait to finish them!",negative,,,,,
880,81,FALSCH,"Katie, I am seeking a PhD in Educational Leadership and Policy Analysis, PK-12 concentration. Not yet 100% set on my dissertation topic, however, I am possibly leaning towards the development of female superintendents.",none,,,,,
880,81,FALSCH,"Hi Katie, Happy Thanksgiving to you as well. I have not tried seltzer yet but I will pick it up next time I go to the store. The break the chain activities are ok. I like thinking about everything quite deliberately.",positive,,,,,
911,83,FALSCH,"Hi Erika madam, 
I have been neglecting lantern messages. I really respect and dedication for your work. I am really grateful for you.",negative,,,,,
952,85,FALSCH,"Oh I thought I had put at least 1's. I'm not really sure. I just haven't really felt any difference or really learned much, but I'm hoping maybe I will later on in the program.",mixed,,,,,
959,85,FALSCH,"Sorry I have been unresponsive, I am going to try and be better this week. I usually preplan my meals after I grocery shop to save time and make healthy choices during the week. My biggest problem is finding things to switch up within my diet so I don't get bored and then eat out or buy junk food and binge on it.",mixed,,,,,
959,85,FALSCH,"Hi Emily I am so sorry, school has been hectic and I completely forgot about the phone call. We can schedule another one for sometime soon!
I made kind of a realization today. I binged and wasn't too upset with myself but I know I will be if it turns into a cycle which it usually does but I knew before it happened that it was going to and I actively chose to let it happen when I knew I had the power to stop it. I view being able to binge as having time to relax. I am able to stop myself from binging by thinking about the aftermath and if I have something important that evening or the following morning I am usually able to prevent it from happening because I know that I will be uncomfortable and upset during whatever I have scheduled. I have been insanely stressed with school, tests, my job, and my two internships that I feel like I have had no down time in the last few weeks and I don't see any down time in my immediate future so today in my 4 hours of freedom before my study group met I let myself binge because I intertwine binging on food with relaxing. I was then so unbelievably full and uncomfortable during studying. I often am able to curb the binges by thinking of how it will affect an event in my future but I still associate binging with relaxing and I need to work on breaking that association. I am excited about this epiphany and that is my new goal for this program. What do you think?",mixed,,,,,
959,85,FALSCH,"grocery shopping is usually fine for me as long as i don't go when i am really hungry. i avoid the aisles with all of the chips and snack food and always have a list of what i want to buy/always buy pretty much the same things when i go. I only keep healthy food in the house so when i do binge or want something ""bad"" i have to go out and buy it and when i do that my problem i don't just buy one thing i buy lots and then eat it all at once.",mixed,,,,,
952,85,FALSCH,"Well I think my self esteem depends on people I interact with or what activities I'm doing that day or how well or poorly I did in certain aspects of my life(sports, school, etc). Im confused on how often I'm supposed to do the techniques on the techniques page. I do them when they come up in each daily session but I'm not doing them besides that since I don't know when/how often they're supposed to be done",negative,,,,,
952,85,FALSCH,"I'm not a huge fan of them. I've tried it in the past, and I've found breathing just makes me annoyed more than I find it helpful",negative,,,,,
952,85,FALSCH,Not really. I'm not sure what else there is besides breathing techniques,negative,,,,,
952,85,FALSCH,"Hi Emily. I've tried yoga and haven't been much a fan, I've thought about writing in a journal but I never really feel like doing so. Piano/playing music probably helps me relax more than other things, but sometimes that really doesn't help at all. Is the body image exercise just the body image tracking?",negative,,,,,
952,85,FALSCH,"Hi Emily, I just had my spring break but I had a lot of rowing so it wasn't much of a break. I was wondering would I be able to stop participating in this program/how would I go about doing so? I'm not finding it very helpful and I would like to stop please",negative,,,,,
952,85,FALSCH,I'm not sure what you mean by consulting with them. These foods are definitely known triggers for it that my doctor has confirmed if that's what you mean,negative,,,,,
952,85,FALSCH,"I don't think I want to eat them. I don't eat gluten or dairy partly because they are found in a lot of u healthy foods(pastries, ice cream, bread etc.) so if I avoid gluten and dairy I avoid those foods. But also gluten and dairy just make me feel sick if I eat more than a mouthful of either one and I also avoid them because they are known to be triggers for ulcerative colitis. So I partly don't eat them because the foods they are in are often unhealthy, but I also don't eat them often for medical reasons. So I don't want to purposefully consume these foods if I don't have to",negative,,,,,
952,85,FALSCH,Most unhealthy foods that I come into contact with have gluten or dairy in them. So since I shouldn't be eating them anyway it provides a convenient excuse to avoid most of them when possible by saying I can't eat them for medical reasons.,negative,,,,,
955,86,FALSCH,Hello Zoe. Sorry I had a very busy week.,negative,,,,,
955,86,FALSCH,Its just that I have really been trying to control what I eat. and I do manage to. Its like I eat very healthy and workout quite a bit for a few days and then lose all control and binge eat for days. I feel that I am unable to control it. Not sure how to go about fixing this.,negative,,,,,
955,86,FALSCH,"Hello Zoe, 
Its nice to hear from you. Thank you.",positive,,,,,
949,88,FALSCH,"Hi Sarah, the tracking isn't helping anymore. I'm keeping to 3 meals and 2 snacks a day but not because of the tracker. I'm going to work on relaxing this weekend and not worry about food",mixed,,,,,
949,88,FALSCH,"Hi sarah! I've noticed as I said in the tracking that every time I feel in control my body image improves, but the moment I'm not, my body image isn't good. I also realized that I have control issues whenever I sit down to watch a series on netflix. If I'm watching something, then I have the urge to eat",mixed,,,,,
949,88,FALSCH,"I start thinking about food when I'm watching nerflix, even when I'm not watching something about food. I don't know why. The good thing is that, even though I have eaten more and felt out of control, it hasn't been as bad as it used to be. I mean that I haven't binged hard like begore, just maybe an extra portion",mixed,,,,,
949,88,FALSCH,"Hi Sarah, I think that my trigger is also nerves. All through the weekend I've been working on a talk I need to give tomorrow and I ended up binging tonight. Still it wasn't as bad as before I started tracking my meals, so that is something at least.",mixed,,,,,
949,88,FALSCH,"Hi Sarah, I've tried the mindfulness exercises but they don't help me. I've also lost interest in the program because it isn't really tailored to the user. It's more of a general thing. For example, I don't have an issue with forbidden foods. For me it's the quantity and I had to go through more than three days of something that was irrelevant to me. I'm going to keep tracking and trying, though",negative,,,,,
949,88,FALSCH,"Hi Sarah! Not so much. Once I got used to tracking I ended up falling for binge eating more often. I don't do it as often as before I started, but it's not as effective as in the beginning.",negative,,,,,
949,88,FALSCH,Hi Sarah! I usually have a meal the size of a large plate at a restaurant. I feel that I should cut it in half,none,,,,,
949,88,FALSCH,"Hi Sarah, I think I'm alright for the weekend. I want to test how this new way of eating every few hours works with social functions and how I can handle it without over eating. Thanks",positive,,,,,
949,88,FALSCH,Thank you for being here and helping!!,positive,,,,,
949,88,FALSCH,"Hi Sarah! I felt good. I'm looking to reduce portion size a little, because it is more than normal people should eat.",positive,,,,,
